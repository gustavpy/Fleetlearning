Our hope is that we can establish a common direction for the strategic work with AI in local government and create opportunities for all municipalities, large and small, to fully harness the possibilities of artificial intelligence,\" says Katarina Lagerqvist, Chief Digital Officer in Kristinehamn Municipality and one of the council's representatives.\nIn a report by DIGG, the Agency for Digital Administration, from 2019, the potential value AI could create in the public sector was estimated at SEK 140 billion annually. A significant portion of this value can be found in Sweden’s municipalities. However, the use of artificial intelligence in municipal administration varies. While some municipalities have several successful use cases to showcase, others have not progressed so far.\nThe conditions for utilizing AI also vary among the municipalities. The skills shortage that many employers in the private sector report also affects municipalities. Structural challenges in administrative models, existing laws, and education hinder development.\nFor these reasons, Vinnova has funded the project \"Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle\" (Joint Effort for AI in Municipalities and Civil Society).\n\"We see a great need for more municipalities to seriously engage in AI usage and to do so in a way that creates conditions for learning from each other and simultaneously addressing important issues together,\" says Fredrik Weisner, Area Manager of Digital Transformation at Vinnova.\nWithin the framework of the project, an AI Council has been established with representatives from twelve municipalities. The council's work is led in collaboration between AI Sweden and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKR). The council's members are chosen to provide the broadest possible representation of Sweden's municipalities. This includes participants from large and small municipalities, those that have started using AI, and those that haven't yet begun. This mix is important for capturing various perspectives on municipalities' use of artificial intelligence, both in terms of the opportunities that technological development brings and the challenges associated with it.\n\"We are now beginning to see the potential that AI has to contribute to the development of welfare, while also needing to identify the conditions that need to be in place and the risks that need to be managed in order to increase Sweden's ability for sustainable transformation. The way forward is through broad collaboration between the public sector, business, and academia. With the AI Council, an important puzzle piece is in place,\" says Ola Odebäck, Head of Finance and Control at SKR.\nThe council's work should primarily focus on cross-municipal strategic issues related to artificial intelligence. The goals are twofold:\n\nIdentify and prioritize areas of application, needs, and strategically relevant questions for increased value creation with AI in Swedish municipalities.\n\n\nDevelop recommendations for concrete initiatives that promote accelerated adoption of AI in the municipal sector.\n\n\"The AI Council is a significant contribution to the development of the Swedish welfare sector. Municipalities need to collaborate on AI matters to create strategic change, overcome obstacles, and effectively prepare for a future where AI changes everything from public administration to welfare services,\" says Jonatan Permert, AI Sweden.\nThe twelve members of the council are:\n\nKatarina Lagerqvist, Chief Digital Officer, Kristinehamn\n\n\nAnna Bengtsson, Digitalization Manager, Herrljunga/Vårgårda\n\n\nStefan Eriksson, Development Manager Digitalization, Gagnef\n\n\nIwona Carlsson, Chief Digital Officer, Kungsbacka\n\n\nBirgitta Zaar, Office Manager Social Services, Värmdö\n\n\nFrédéric Rambaud, Digitalization Strategist, Strängnäs\n\n\nFredrik Edholm, Digitalization Strategist, Skövde\n\n\nMathias Andersson, Data Scientist/AI Lead, Helsingborg\n\n\nMårten Lindskog, AI Coordinator, Stockholm\n\n\nFredrik Hallgren, Development Manager AI, Gothenburg\n\n\nJari Koponen, Program Manager Digitalization Action Plan, Sundsvall\n\n\nTorbjörn Svedung, CDO/CISO, Mellerud\n\nBackground on Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle (Joint Effort for AI in Municipalities and Civil Society)\nWithin the project Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle, AI Sweden supports municipalities and civil society organizations in various ways in practical implementation.

Vår förhoppning är att vi kan etablera en gemensam riktning för det strategiska arbetet med AI inom den lokala förvaltningen och skapa möjligheter för alla kommuner, stora och små, att fullt ut dra nytta av möjligheterna med artificiell intelligens,\" säger Katarina Lagerqvist, Chief Digital Officer i Kristinehamns kommun och en av rådets representanter.\nI en rapport från DIGG, myndigheten för digital förvaltning, från 2019, uppskattades den potentiella värdet som AI kan skapa inom den offentliga sektorn till 140 miljarder kronor årligen. En betydande del av detta värde återfinns i Sveriges kommuner. Emellertid varierar användningen av artificiell intelligens inom kommunal förvaltning. Medan vissa kommuner har flera framgångsrika användningsområden att visa upp, har andra inte kommit lika långt.\nFörutsättningarna för att utnyttja AI varierar också mellan kommunerna. Den kompetensbrist som många arbetsgivare inom privat sektor rapporterar om påverkar också kommunerna. Strukturella utmaningar i administrativa modeller, befintliga lagar och utbildning hindrar utvecklingen.\nAv dessa skäl har Vinnova finansierat projektet \"Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle\".\n\"Vi ser ett stort behov av att fler kommuner seriöst engagerar sig i användningen av AI och gör det på ett sätt som skapar förutsättningar för att lära av varandra och samtidigt hantera viktiga frågor tillsammans,\" säger Fredrik Weisner, områdeschef för digital transformation på Vinnova.\nInom ramen för projektet har ett AI-råd inrättats med representanter från tolv kommuner. Rådets arbete leds i samarbete mellan AI Sweden och Sveriges Kommuner och Regioner (SKR). Rådets medlemmar är utvalda för att ge den bredast möjliga representationen av Sveriges kommuner. Detta inkluderar deltagare från stora och små kommuner, de som har börjat använda AI och de som ännu inte har påbörjat det. Denna blandning är viktig för att fånga olika perspektiv på kommuners användning av artificiell intelligens, både när det gäller möjligheterna som teknikutvecklingen medför och de utmaningar som är förknippade med den.\n\"Vi börjar nu se potentialen som AI har att bidra till utvecklingen av välfärden, samtidigt som vi behöver identifiera de villkor som måste vara på plats och de risker som måste hanteras för att öka Sveriges förmåga till hållbar transformation. Vägen framåt går genom ett brett samarbete mellan offentlig sektor, näringsliv och akademi. Med AI-rådet är en viktig pusselbit på plats,\" säger Ola Odebäck, chef för ekonomi och kontroll på SKR.\nRådets arbete bör i första hand fokusera på tvärkommunala strategiska frågor relaterade till artificiell intelligens. Målen är dubbla:\n\nIdentifiera och prioritera områden för tillämpning, behov och strategiskt relevanta frågor för ökad värdeskapande med AI i svenska kommuner.\n\n\nUtveckla rekommendationer för konkreta initiativ som främjar snabbare antagande av AI inom den kommunala sektorn.\n\n\"AI-rådet är ett betydande bidrag till utvecklingen av den svenska välfärdssektorn. Kommuner behöver samarbeta i AI-frågor för att skapa strategisk förändring, övervinna hinder och effektivt förbereda sig för en framtid där AI förändrar allt från offentlig förvaltning till välfärdstjänster,\" säger Jonatan Permert, AI Sweden.\nDe tolv medlemmarna i rådet är:\n\nKatarina Lagerqvist, Chief Digital Officer, Kristinehamn\n\n\nAnna Bengtsson, Digitalization Manager, Herrljunga/Vårgårda\n\n\nStefan Eriksson, Development Manager Digitalization, Gagnef\n\n\nIwona Carlsson, Chief Digital Officer, Kungsbacka\n\n\nBirgitta Zaar, Office Manager Social Services, Värmdö\n\n\nFrédéric Rambaud, Digitalization Strategist, Strängnäs\n\n\nFredrik Edholm, Digitalization Strategist, Skövde\n\n\nMathias Andersson, Data Scientist/AI Lead, Helsingborg\n\n\nMårten Lindskog, AI Coordinator, Stockholm\n\n\nFredrik Hallgren, Development Manager AI, Gothenburg\n\n\nJari Koponen, Program Manager Digitalization Action Plan, Sundsvall\n\n\nTorbjörn Svedung, CDO/CISO, Mellerud\n\nBakgrund om Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle (Gemensam insats för AI i kommuner och civilsamhället)\nBakgrund om Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle Inom projektet Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle stödjer AI Sweden kommuner och organisationer inom civilsamhället på olika sätt i praktisk genomförande.

At Kompetenscentrum AI, Isak Barbopoulos and his colleagues work closely together with physicians and other healthcare professionals to understand where and how AI can be applied within healthcare. VGR needs to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with many different tasks, both for medical staff as well as patients.\n\"LLMs for triaging is one thing we want to explore. Could we use language models to help narrow down possible diagnoses by transcribing a phone call in real-time, search for different symptoms, match them against a list of diagnoses, and suggest follow-up questions to ask the patient\", says Isak Barbopoulos.\nWith the help of the summer internship program, VGR has been able to advance four such use case ideas over the summer.\n\"This gives us a good foundation for our continued work during the autumn. We have a better understanding of possible technical solutions, regulatory questions we need to address, etc. Getting involved in the internship program has definitely helped us accelerate,\" says Isak Barbopoulos.\nMore summer programs to come\nThe GPT Summer Internship Program is the third of its kind that AI Sweden coordinates. The first one, the Industrial Immersion Exchange in Cyber Security was started in 2022 and got a sequel this year that took place in parallel with the GPT program.\n\"We see that this is a way to really accelerate the use of AI in Swedish organizations, where the students help the participating organizations to quickly understand how AI can be applied\", says Mats Nordlund, Head of Data Factory at AI Sweden, and continues:\n\"One of the key takeaways from the GPT program this year is that the LLMs are much further along than many organizations expected, both in terms of technical performance and how easy it is to use them as a base for developing customized applications.\"\nTogether with colleagues at AI Sweden, Mats Nordlund is already planning for the summer of 2024:\n\"We expect to run programs like this next year as well.

This is where AI Sweden’s AI Maturity Assessment comes in, a process that helps organizations evaluate their current AI capabilities and identify actions for advancing their AI maturity.

The Police Authority became partners of AI Sweden in November 2022, and decided to start their partnership with  NFC participating in the AI Maturity Assessment process facilitated by AI Sweden.\nWe see that we have a journey to make when it comes to AI. Everything that the Police and NFC do is to benefit society, and if we can use AI to develop and streamline the organization, it’s only a win-win for everyone” says Anders Åström, business developer at NFC.\n\nThe AI Maturity Assessment process\nThe Assessment helps partners understand which strategically important areas need to be strengthened to work with AI successfully and systematically.\nEvaluating one's AI maturity is important for the digital transformation journey of public organizations. Through the AI Maturity Assessment process, the organization gains a better understanding and coordination of its strengths and areas for development within AI, and receives a concrete plan for increasing its AI maturity. This leads to better decisions and resource utilization, and ultimately to faster AI development, resulting in improved public services for citizens” says Jonatan Permert, AI Transformation Strategist at AI Sweden.\n\nThe assessment process consisted of an evaluation survey and a  workshop focused on interpreting the results in the context of NFC and guiding participants on how to approach and incorporate AI technology within their organization.\nDoing the maturity assessment was a great start for us into our AI-development journey. It provided us with a great overview of how the knowledge of AI is in our organization, as well as spreading the knowledge about the need for AI” Anders says.\n\nWork ahead\nNFC recently completed the assessment and is now exploring how to proceed and integrate the technology into other areas of their organization.\nIt’s clear that the general understanding of AI needs to be increased. We are looking at starting up some pilot projects with a focus on understanding how we can use AI when we analyze our statistics” Anders says.\n\nAre you interested in AI Sweden’s AI Maturity Assessment?Read more here and start your AI transformation journey\nNFC has a lot of knowledge and experience that they hope they can contribute to the community.

Den gav oss en bra översikt över hur kunskapen om AI är i vår organisation, samt sprida kunskapen om behovet av AI\", säger Anders.\n\nArbete framåt\nNFC har nyligen avslutat bedömningen och utforskar nu hur man ska gå vidare och integrera tekniken i andra delar av sin organisation.\n\nDet är tydligt att den allmänna förståelsen för AI behöver öka.

I’ve learned so much. It has really widened my perspective of what you can do with AI,” Pavlo says. \nModeling crime scenes and anomaly detection\nEvery week they study new topics, do assignments, and work with projects from AI Sweden partners or departments. For instance, Pavlo is working together with the National Forensic Center on modeling crime scenes with different sorts of collected and combined data. \nHlib is working on anomaly detection in videos together with Combitech. He tells us that one problem they try to solve is GDPR-related questions and how to blur faces in videos, which is one aspect of working with face detection. Both projects stem from partner needs which Hlib and Pablo emphasize adds value to the program because you create impact for the real world. \nLearning by doing\nSometimes, challenges and technical issues pop up along the way. \n“When you’re stuck you have to search for answers yourself. It makes you grow as an individual and you learn how to solve problems and who to ask questions,” Pavlo says. \nBoth Pavlo and Hlib agree that the program is good if you want to work with professionals within AI and try new things. One becomes a part of the whole journey, from research to implementation. \n“If you want to belong to a great community, you should apply for this program.

It is a guide and a template to help organizations set their AI vision faster and with better results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white paper is a guide developed to help organizations create their AI vision faster and with better results. This practical tool is the product of AI Swedens and the collaborating partners combined experiences. It explains what an AI vision is, the process of creating it and how to communicate it. In addition to the white paper, an easy-to-use template accompanies it.  \nWho can benefit from using the white paper?\nPrivate or public, any organization that wants to work more with AI could benefit from it. Ideally, an AI vision is developed after the organization has developed its first experiments or proof of concepts. The AI vision serves as a roadmap for further scaling. \nWhy did we create the AI Vision White Paper?\n“We wanted to create this white paper because it is something all of us would have loved to have access to when we first started working on setting an AI strategy. By getting this paper out, the hope is to help other organizations speed up their process and bring clarity,” says Lucas Ambjörn, Expert in Digitization and AI Transformation at Zenseact, one of the contributors to the whitepaper. \nAnother contributor, Cecilia Hahn Berg, Strategist for Life Science at Sahlgrenska University Hospital also shares her view on how the paper could benefit organizations:\n “Spending 30 minutes reading through the white paper will hopefully pay back in at least two ways. Firstly, to speed up the process to decide if an AI vision will benefit your organization at all. Second, the white paper will help you understand how to set up the process to create an AI vision.” \nRead more and download the AI Vision White Paper here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nContact Conny Svensson if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have feedback or want to share your experience of working with setting an AI vision!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Conny Svensson\n\n\nDirector of AI Adoption\nconny.svensson@ai.se\n+46 (0)70-315 94 98"}

Eternal Life). This is a chance for the public to experience the complexity and depth of the GPT-SW3 model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping the chatbot known as Klara\nThe chatbot is based on the Swedish Large Language Models (GPT-SW3) that the NLU team at AI Sweden together with RISE and WASP WARA Media & Language are developing. A chatbot is only one of many things you can use these models for and GPT-SW3 was developed with much broader applications in mind.\nThe chatbot is designed to be a version of the artificial friend, the humanoid Klara from the book ‘Klara and the sun’ by Kazuo Ishiguro. The team created it as part of the Nobel Prize Museum exhibition Eternal Life. \nAI Sweden was invited to contribute to the exhibition and decided to explore the space of art, interactive AI and literature. This ‘AI for art’ use case provided the opportunity to test GPT-SW3 in a real world application; build competence in how to instruct models and build solutions; and enable open ended dialogue with a chatbot based on the first generative Swedish language model. \nThe author kindly granted us permission to use his novel as inspiration and AI Sweden is thrilled to be able to present the character to the public this way.\nThe team wrote a prompt to create the Chatbot Klara, using traits that the character in the book displays. For example, Klara is always kind, always reflective, and very friendly.\nThe model is able to imitate Klara’s character with so-called few-shot learning. The team gave the chatbot a task description and an identity. They wrote a prompt consisting of three components: a task description, a conversation as an example, and an input indicating that we expect a response from our AI friend.\n\n \nHow is this exhibition important for AI Sweden?\nThis project is an interesting exploration of technology which bridges art and science. It’s also a way for people to experience the latest developments in the field of AI. Dagens Nyheter has written a thoughtful review of the exhibition and what it’s like to ‘talk’ with Klara here. \nAI Sweden is proud that Alice Heiman, Young Researcher with the NLU team, has won Developer of the Year at the Nordic Women in Tech Awards. She was one of the contributors to Chatbot Klara. \nAlice developed the prompt to make a chatbot out of the GPT-SW3 model. She created what people might experience as the chatbot’s personality by giving the model instructions in the prompt governing its behavior and tonality. \n \nWho is this exhibition for?\nAnyone who is interested in seeing the latest Swedish AI in the form of an artwork. You can interact with the chatbot at the Eternal Life exhibition, Liljevalchs Konsthall in Stockholm, which is open until January 29, 2023. AI Sweden doesn’t know yet what the future holds for Chatbot Klara, but hopes that she will continue her journey."}

Artificial intelligence is one such area, due to the rise of AI applications. AI Sweden together with partner Combitech have teamed up to offer a talent program called AI in Mind to attract this expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnders Sandblad, consultant at the Nordic tech solutions and consulting company Combitech, has over 20 years of experience in software development. Lately, he’s been working with Combitech’s several talent programs.  At the moment, his focus is on AI in Mind with the current cohort starting October 25, 2022. AI in Mind is one of several AI Sweden talent programs and is a further development of the well-established Combitech Talent Program, offered to partners of AI Sweden. \n“AI in Mind started a year ago as the result of collaboration between Combitech and AI Sweden,” Anders says. He describes the talent program as a great way to support new employees and quickly boost their skills during their first two years at Combitech and to prepare them for future workplaces.\nThe program works as one of many initiatives to meet the growing demand for AI expertise in Sweden, with the fast-paced development demanding more motivated and interested people. Sweden is still at an early stage of using and working with AI technology, where  AI Sweden is working towards accelerating the AI transformation in society on many different levels. The co-created talent programs that AI Sweden offers together with their partners are one step on that journey. Today, AI is already used in many people’s daily lives, and by increasing the expertise in Sweden, society could benefit even more from AI solutions.\nWhat to expect from AI in Mind\nAbout 10-12 new university graduates are accepted per cohort. The program is structured in three parts and offers customized courses in AI technology, people skills, and last but not least, experience development which adds a unique value to the program.  \nDuring the experience development section, participants discuss different topics and situations that have come up in their assignments at customer companies. Anders is in charge of this part of the program and thinks it’s an important way for candidates to grow into experienced employees. It’s all about understanding what happened in specific situations and learning how to handle them. The participants get input from each other’s different experiences at the seminars.\n“The first topic is about being new at your job. How do we get the hang of what we’re supposed to do when we’re new at work? At the seminar, the participants share stories from real-life experiences and reflect on them together,” Anders says. \nCombitech has reported that as a result of the talent program, participants develop not only their confidence and ability to handle difficult or unexpected situations, but also become more collaboratively minded, which is essential when you’re working in a new team.\nCandidates who can take on leadership roles\nFor AI in Mind, Combitech and AI Sweden try to select individuals who they believe have the ability to take on leadership roles in the future. Many of them have a data or computer science background. \n“As a consultant company, you need to learn about how a customer’s organization works. We’ve had discussions with AI Sweden and other partners about what is expected from future AI developers. This creates huge value for us, and gives us the ability to design the talent program in order to prepare the candidates the best we can,”  reports Anders.\nOne of the most important outcomes of AI in Mind, according to Anders, is learning how to learn from your work-life experiences. You learn how to reflect, which is an important skill and a part of a life-long learning process.\nIs your organization in need of AI talent? Please contact Niclas Fock, Head of Talent Programs to find out more. We encourage interested students to keep an eye on careers.ai.se to be notified about all AI Sweden’s talent programs."}

This is done in only a couple of hours in many instances. \nKim Henriksson, Testbed Architect at the Data Factory, describes the typical process. “Together, we take a deep dive into their topic. At the first discussion we can share knowledge and ideas, explain the equipment and available datasets. We can suggest a step-by-step approach to address the topic and recommend whom they could partner up with. Our goals are to help our partners accelerate their AI journey by reducing risks, lower barriers, and speed up innovation.” \nCreating legal space for innovation\nThe Data Factory team has become experienced at navigating the requirements of GDPR and can recommend datasets that simplify compliance, enhance the opportunities for collaboration and reduce time to get started. Such datasets can be ‘pre-approved’ datasets hosted at AI Sweden, (using representative data to explore infrastructure), or certain open datasets.  Partners have access to knowledge sharing from previous projects and advice from colleagues here to enable new projects to benefit from work done in the past.\nSee more previous partner projects at the Data Factory:\nZenseact autonomous driving projectRoad Data LabSpace HackathonBaltic Seabird HackatonCyber Security for edge learningData Factory Knowledge Hub\nTo begin work in the data factory infrastructure, the first step is to sign a use case specification document. This clarifies who is responsible, for what purpose is the work being done, which data set will be used, and when the project is planned to begin. This step also includes GDPR-related agreements if necessary.\n“We’ve essentially gotten it down to a series of yes and no questions. We want to make it as accessible as possible for everyone,” says Kim. Even when partners have come with ideas that are not fully formed, the team can help guide them to a concrete idea very quickly. Since everything is signed digitally, in ideal cases, it can take only a few hours of meetings to finalize everything. \nGetting started\nAI Sweden makes the Data Factory, all its resources, and all our expertise available to all partner organizations. Anyone at our partner organizations with an idea can reach out to us and we will try to make it happen. What could your organization learn by investing a couple of hours to explore the possibilities?\nIf you want to learn more about the Data Factory you can find more information here.

Contact Niclas.Fock@ai.se to arrange an intern placement or project now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hyper Island interns joined AI Sweden in September for the second half of their two-year course. The program is highly collaborative, with AI Sweden and our partners contributing to their education, projects they take part in, and hosting them as interns. The candidates are, in many instances, seasoned professionals who have chosen to upskill for a career working with AI. They are ready to support partners as soon as may be, so get in touch with Niclas Fock to discuss your staffing needs. \nWe carefully selected those who can contribute to AI Sweden and the needs of the partner community. Partners who worked with the Hyper Island AI Change Agents during the spring were really impressed and excited. This year, along with a new class of Jr AI Change Agents, we have introduced a second group of talents from Hyper Island, the Data Readiness Agents. \nIf your organization is interested in taking advantage of these interns' skills and time, contact Niclas Fock now. \nPreparing future AI professionals\nAI Sweden is giving them special training in selecting and reviewing data, judging data quality and preparing for AI model training. The objective is to provide an overview of what the participants might encounter in their professional life in the field of AI. Together with our partners we cover use-cases, perspectives and insights on the challenges connected to organizations adopting AI. Speakers from over 15 different partners will contribute to their education. \nSimultaneously, the interns are working on a wide variety of projects that are variously live or still at the concept stage. The interns must then assess and present plans for. They identify the scope and deliverables, and determine what they may personally contribute. This tests their initiative, ability to evaluate and to deliver within a larger team. \n \n\nThe interns started their training at AI Sweden, September 2022.\n \n\nPartner organizations see tangible results\nPartners have testified to how beneficial this program was for them this spring. Two of the interns from the last cohort worked at Region Östergötland helping to conduct the AI Maturity Report. They helped the region to understand its current AI maturity level. Knowing this helped the decision of where to be in 12-18 months' time and how to get there. As a result, Region Östergötland is using this information to prepare a pilot combining AI and traffic planning.\n“I was a bit skeptical [of] AI Sweden in the beginning but can now conclude that if we hadn’t got the support with the AI Maturity Report we probably wouldn't have begun now but instead pushed it forward as far forward as possible.” Carin Carelind, R&D Manager, Östgötatrafiken (part of Region Östergötland). \n \nLucas Ambjörn from last year’s cohort completed his internship at Zenseact and is now employed there full-time as an AI Change Agent. He is, among other things, responsible for developing an AI Vision for them and implementing it in the organization. \n \nReady for new career challenges\nThe interns already have clear ideas about what they can contribute to partners and how they will effect improvements. \n“As a data analyst, I see data readiness knowledge as a crucial part of my future work. I believe this training will give me a holistic understanding of the data ecosystem in any organization or business. I will be equipped with tools and frameworks to run complex projects either within AI or data analysis.” Kristina Tumanova, Data Analyst\n“It’s not enough to just speak the language of data or business or information systems architecture. In conversations at my former job, I recognized the need to bridge the siloes of IT and Business and implement technology with an eye on everyone’s process, intended value and domain knowledge. I hope to use this experience to enable people to think differently and help them realize they can understand seemingly new or foreign concepts just through a different interpretation.” Tab Bainum, Junior AI Change Agent\n\n \nHow can my organization benefit?\nPartners may receive 1-2 interns working with the challenges partners specify. This may start now (October 2022). They can join as full-time interns from January 2023 until the end of March 2023.\nTeams of talents from one or from several programs, combining different skills, could form a project to work with a project task provided by partners. This could be a work of technical nature, or a study of needs and opportunities related to the partner business or market from an AI perspective.\nPartners may invite interns to do a site visit\nPartners share a company presentation and a lecture about AI work within their organizations\nThese are just some of the ways partners can get involved.\n \nWhat is the goal of the program?\nThe Talent programs provide partners with AI talent, as AI Sweden has seen that this need is huge and growing rapidly. Upon completing our programs, the candidates are available for job offers. Partners contribute lectures and projects so the interns get the most relevant education possible. Establishing contact during their internship is hugely beneficial for partners and for the candidate themselves to find the best use for their skills. \n \nTo get involved as a partner, contact Niclas Fock."}

Her team cultivate international partnerships which bring talent and business investment to Sweden, as well as raising AI Sweden’s voice internationally to influence common standards and best practices. \nAs a representative of AI Sweden, a small but sometimes mighty global player, Agneta knows the value of collaboration. “We need to prioritize who to work with carefully and focus on the ones that can provide maximum value to our partners. This also means we need to understand in what ways Sweden is attractive and thus how we can best offer high value to our international partners,” she says.\nSweden has a particular strength, she says, as the home of lots of big actors in many different types of industries as well as being one of the best startup hubs in the world. Agneta describes the setup that AI Sweden has with collaborating partners from large corporates, public sector, academia, SMEs and startups as unique and thus very attractive. Beyond that, it’s about the close relationships we have with ‘need owners’. Those are the regions, hospitals, and corporates with issues to be solved, and good, solid, established organizations that have just started their AI transformation journey. Agneta is focused on the international stage, and she sees that researchers and startups or scaleups have an interest in collaborations with these need owners. Complementing this, AI Sweden’s partners can benefit highly from the innovation and energy those researchers and businesses bring.\n“It’s important to have our tentacles out there to learn, absorb and pick up good practices that we can bring to Sweden.” \nShe believes, like all of AI Sweden, that the way forwards is through partnership. We are forging strong relationships with European partners. The team has made important connections for advocacy and which give us access to academia. Before the summer of 2022 AI Sweden signed an agreement to set up the CLAIRE Stockholm Office. Agneta’s team has also brought us in as members of European associations BDVA and ADRA. Now they are working on yet more collaboration opportunities, to be announced this autumn. \nTheir efforts have already brought tangible results. The AI Maturity Assessment Tool is a great example of collaborative and iterative work. The tool was adapted from the appliedAI Initiative of UnternehmerTUM in Germany.  “We have contributed to improve the original that they had. It’s helped us to achieve something faster and learn from another organization,” says Agneta.\nShe points to our hugely important partnership with Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, one of the most interesting AI research organizations. Mila, and its founder Yoshua Bengio, are important reasons behind Montreal being one of the strongest AI ecosystems in the world. Sweden is working hard to attract that type of talent. AI Sweden is building an ecosystem with determined and skillful people. Agneta has a strong philosophy guiding our strategy:\n“It’s important to have our tentacles out there to learn, absorb and pick up good practices that we can bring to Sweden. In return Sweden can contribute much towards a thriving international AI ecosphere.”\nThe international team’s work has dramatically improved our access to international research opportunities for our partners. Agneta is enthusiastic about the effects of the team’s work. “We are always looking to make connections between partners who need solutions and academic resources with a specific focus. This way we can offer our partners the best value possible.”  \nIf you have questions or ideas for collaboration, reach out to Agneta here. \nRead more about the international team's work here."}

Having followed how ongoing legislative deliberations have unfolded in Brussels, AI Sweden is proposing several recommendations to avoid undermining Europe’s competitiveness and digital ambitions.\nThe main points in the position paper are:\nEnsure that the definition of AI is in line with the commonly accepted OECD definition of AI\nAvoid double-verification processes and exclude AI systems that are already covered by EU safety regulations\nHigh-risk AI should only include systems that may pose a potentially high risk to safety or fundamental rights\nAdding the concept of General Purpose AI makes the legislation ambiguous when it comes to liability and responsibility\nStronger mandate for the AI board\nTask the AI board with writing an interim report after a minimum of two years after the legislation enters into force\nSimilar rules across the globe – Strive for similar AI rulebooks in democratic states\nRead the position paper with the full recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPosition paper AI Act\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t184.95 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to engage in influencing the negotiations on the AI Act, in line with this position paper, please contact Mikael Ljungblom.\nOn a general note, partners are encouraged to make use of this position paper in what way they see fit. For example, by referring to it in their own positions, taking inspiration from it or spreading it to relevant decisionmakers.\nBackground\nThe negotiations are currently being guided by the Czech Presidency in the Council of Ministers and will be taken over by the Swedish Presidency from January 1, 2023. In parallel, the European Parliament is developing their position with a final vote expected in November 2022. Once the positions of both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament have been finalized, the two institutions will hold a final negotiation together with the European Commission. This will likely take place during the spring of 2023."}

They are a part of an exchange program spending four weeks in Gothenburg, Sweden and four weeks in Madison, South Dakota.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe five students are in the middle of their industrial immersion program, having just completed their four weeks in Gothenburg, Sweden. When we spoke to them they were enjoying their exchange in South Dakota, USA.\nWhat are they working on?\nThe team is researching federated learning models and the intersection with cybersecurity. The goal is to discover a solution to detect and prevent poisoned nodes from impacting a federated learning model.\nThe team at AI Sweden supported them in the beginning with expertise and resources on AI models. Now the team in the USA is providing help on cybersecurity. The timing has worked out perfectly for the project’s structure.\nThe solution they are pursuing will be widely applicable. Jason Mixon told us, “we’re not focusing on a specific industry. We’re generalizing our implementation, but the industry we had the most conversations with was the automotive.”\n“Meeting the partners was very cool because they’re big names you’ve heard of all your life and you get to have meetings… I still feel a bit starstruck..” – Madeleine Englund, Umeå University\n\nHow did they get started?\nDiving straight into orientation week at AI Sweden in Gothenburg, the students had lots of time with the partners and our team. “I loved it, I think it gave us a challenge to dig into federated learning and understand the topic. All the meetings and presentations from the partners really helped,” said Viktor Valadi. “I think it influenced us a lot.”\nThey started to work together as a team to brainstorm potential topics. With feedback from partners, they narrowed it down to one which had great potential, matched the scope of the exchange program and was feasible in the two month timeframe.\nThe team will first present their findings to AI Sweden and partner organizations, then to industry partners. There is an opportunity to extend the research past the initial two months and partners will get to take advantage of the results. We’re looking forward to seeing partners implement the solutions that arise.\nWhat they said about the process:\n“It was nice to have interdisciplinary teams.” -Madeleine\nThe students came together as a functioning team very quickly. Viktor told us, “we’ve been able to branch out a bit towards what we’re good at and it’s working out.” Madeleine expressed it similarly: “I think we complement each other… What one lacks, another has a strength in.”  \n“It was a big departure from what I'm used to, considering I've been mostly an academic student my entire life. It’s usually a very strict ‘you’re going to do this, and then you’re going to do that’. So it was kinda nice actually to have something new, a new experience.” – Charles Novak, Dakota State University.\n\nSeveral students have made connections with industry partner contacts to collaborate with for their Masters theses. All intend to stay in touch with partner companies with direct contact or further research after the exchange program. “I’m reaching out to everyone on LinkedIn,” said Madeleine. “I’ll ask people some questions… I think the projects we’ve seen are great.” -Charles  \nResources in Sweden and USA\nThe students met AI Sweden’s team and Swedish partners. They worked with Kim Henriksson, Project Manager at Edge Lab to get access and hardware for their AI models. When they progressed to the Madison Cyber Labs they were working with the cybersecurity resources and expertise from the team there. “At DSU we have people who give us ideas and keep us on track with our project… Sweden had really good AI resources and in the USA they had a more cybersecurity focus.” -Jason\nMats Nordlund, Head of Data Factory for AI Sweden, made a big impression. He’s been a great resource for the students for information and career advice.\n \nIs your organization ready to develop AI talents?

The model is now ready for partners to test, in a joint effort to validate the model in real-life applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, AI Sweden presented GPT-SW3, with approximately 3.5 billion parameters. GPT-SW3 builds on 106 GB Swedish text and has been trained in a collaborative effort between AI Sweden and RISE on Linköpings University’s supercomputer, Berzelius, using the Megatron framework from NVIDIA. \nBuilding large scale language models for the Swedish and other Nordic languages can only be achieved in a collaborative and joint effort of different actors who contribute with competence, data, and computing power. During summer 2022, AI Sweden will in collaboration with WASP WARA Media & Language and RISE train a significantly larger GPT-SW3 model with up to 175 billion parameters and around 1 TB of text data, primarily in Swedish, but also in Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and English.\nFollow the process, the training, and our NLU team’s reflections on our brand new Medium page.\nAI Sweden on Medium\nAs the size of the model grows, it will become more competent in all kinds of language processing tasks (e.g. text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, idea generation, and so on). Very large language models have been shown to exhibit zero-shot capacity, which means that the model can solve tasks even without being specifically trained for the task. These models have the potential to revolutionize the ways in which text data can be processed, analyzed and utilized. They open up for completely new ways of creating societal, citizen and customer benefits.\nOne important step in the development of very large language models is testing and validation, which also requires a communal effort. This includes exploring the possibilities and limitations of the models (e.g. biases in the training data of the models can have negative effects in certain use-cases). We therefore now invite AI Sweden’s partners to test and validate the first iteration of GPT-SW3 and to share their feedback with us. \nIn this way, we can together accelerate the use of AI for the benefit of our society, our competitiveness, and for everyone living in Sweden. \nDo you want access to GPT-SW3?\nWe need more hands on deck to explore and test GPT-SW3.

By using AI to mimic how humans would do it. That's the idea behind Annotell's winning entry in Zenseact's Edge Annotation Challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotell, just like Zenseact an AI Sweden partner, specializes in software tools that help companies annotate their training data, by supporting the human annotators. They just joined - and won - the Zenseact Edge AnnotationZ Challenge with their entry on how to annotate on the edge.\nA key factor was using data on how humans approach the annotation of images. Roland Meertens, Perception expert at Annotell, explains how:\n“For example, humans change the view of the image by zooming, or changing the contrast or the colors. Humans also trace objects over multiple frames. If an object has been identified in the sequence before the frame that's being annotated, it's possible to understand what's in that frame as well, even if you only see a small part of the object.”\nJonatan Kallus, Machine learning engineer at Annotell, explains the last part further:\n“If you have a complete point cloud from the LIDAR that is also nearby, it's easy to understand what it is. But if it's only part of an object and/or further away, recognizing it becomes much harder. This is where the frame sequence can provide valuable information: If you have already detected a car in previous frames, you can calculate it's approximate location in the key frame and based on the available sensor data find exactly where it is.”\nBased on these observations, Roland Meertens, Jonatan Kallus, Clément Dardenne, and Luca Caltagirone were able to develop a method for imitating human annotation allowing for automated annotations on the edge.\n \nFacts\nRead more on the EdgeAnnotationZ Challenge organized by Zenseact, AI Sweden, RISE, Lund University, Chalmers Industriteknik and Univrses, in collaboration with CGit and MobilityXLab.\nCurious about the dataset that was used? Check it out and learn more.\nWant to donate a dataset for the AI Sweden network to work on? Contact Ebba Josefson Lindqvist.\nInterested in setting up a hackathon challenge?

This allows them to use sensor data from the customer cars to improve the performance of its autonomous driving software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe underlying need for automatic annotation on the edge is simple: Zenseact wants to extract value from the data collected by all cars where the company's technology is used.\nDeveloping technology for autonomous cars means crunching a lot of sensor data. Zenseact's platform uses cameras, LIDAR, high-precision GPS, and other sources to understand what is happening in the surroundings and have the car act accordingly.\n“We have our own fleet of development cars, from which we collect data to train our models. But compared to the number of cars where our customers have deployed our technology, our fleet is much smaller”, says Benny Nilsson, Head of Emerging Technologies at Zenseact.\nTherefore, Zenseact would like to access the data collected by the sold cars to train their models. However, this is so far an unsolved problem. Why? GDPR and privacy regulations is one challenge. \n“This comes down to both the privacy of the driver, if he or she drives to sensitive destinations, and also the privacy of pedestrians and other persons in the car's surroundings.”\nAnother challenge is the vast volume of data collected. Transferring all data from the cars to central servers would require a lot of bandwidth. All in all, this means that the sold cars are an untapped resource of data for Zenseact.\n\"We need a way to annotate data at the edge\"\n\nInstead of moving the raw data from the individual nodes to a central data storage for training, edge learning and decentralized AI allows for training the models at each node and sending the result back to the central location where the information contributes to a larger model. This way, no sensitive data is transferred and the data volume drastically decreases.\n“The majority of Zenseact autonomous driving tasks require supervision in the form of annotations for training at the edge. Traditionally, highly skilled human annotators provide these annotations that are often not accessible at the edge. Even if we could find a way to incentivize the customer cars’ occupants, there is no guarantee they would follow the detailed annotation guidelines properly. Therefore, Zenseact needs new methods to generate high-quality annotations automatically at the edge”, says Mina Alibeigi, AI Researcher in Zenseact’s Technology and Collaboration Team.\n\"Running a hackathon with external participants is an excellent way to get inspiration from other sectors\"\n\nZenseact therefore teamed up with AI Sweden to challenge the AI community to find a solution. By inviting external teams to the challenge, there was an input of a variety of ideas from developers with different background and working sectors other than the automotive industry. \n“Automating annotations the way we need to and on the edge is still an open question. We have run internal hackathons before, but those have had a much more defined solution space. The challenge in this hackathon is on a more conceptual level, and because of that we decided to invite external teams”, says Benny Nilsson.\nThe Challenge resulted in five different ideas on how the annotation problem could be solved - providing Zenseact with concrete solutions and ways forward.\nBut there is another value in a hackathon with external teams:\n“It becomes somewhat of a recruitment process, both for finding individuals to hire, or researchers or companies to work with”, says Benny Nilsson.\nAdditionally, running the Challenge together with AI Sweden in the Data Factory gave the Challenge a neutral setting. \n“Intellectual properties are owned by the participating team. But uploading their code to Zenseact's servers could still have been a show-stopper for some. The neutral setting of the Data Factory made a big difference. Another benefit from Zenseact's partnership with AI Sweden was AI Sweden's network, which was used to market the hackathon” says Benny Nilsson.\n \nFacts\nRead more on the EdgeAnnotationZ Challenge organized by Zenseact, AI Sweden, RISE, Lund University, Chalmers Industriteknik and Univrses, in collaboration with CGit and MobilityXLab.\nLearn about the winning entry by Annotell.\nCurious about the dataset that was used?

It is very exciting to see that already after just six months from initiating the Talent Programs, we have so many talents out working with partners and making a real difference in the AI ecosystem”, says Niclas Fock, Head of Talent Programs at AI Sweden.\nThe overarching idea for AI Sweden’s talent programs is based on three cornerstones.\nTraining the individual talents.\nGetting AI competence out to our partners.\nGrowing the AI ecosystem in Sweden.\nThe participants in AI Sweden’s talent programs spent the autumn working on projects at AI Sweden and together with partners. During the spring, they are now working at 20 different partner organizations during four days a week, while spending one day a week at AI Sweden.\nAre you interested in hosting AI talent at your organization? All talent programs are now opening up for a new cohort - reach out to Niclas Fock to learn more.\nMore about our Talent Programs and the organizations hosting this year’s cohort\n\nYoung Talent Program\nTogether with ABB-gymnasiet, AI Sweden is piloting the Young Talent Program with students who just graduated from high school. The first cohort studied Teknikspets within AI at ABB-gymnasiet. They have extensive knowledge of AI tools and frameworks, and have already worked on concrete projects during their studies. Until summer, they now do internships at Combitech, Smartr, Statistics Sweden, and Zenseact. \n\nJunior AI Change Agent Program\nThe Junior AI Change Agent Program is a collaboration between AI Sweden and Hyper Island. The program consists of two periods over six months: Three months boost at AI Sweden and three months internship at a selected AI Sweden partner. The first cohort are now doing their internship at CGit, Ericsson, Google, KPMG, Region Östergötland, Smartilizer, Smartr, and Zenseact.\nEye for AI - International Talent Program\nEye for AI is a unique 18-months program where AI talents from around the world are matched with 3 organizations and spend 6 months at each placement. At the end of the program the talents can be hired by the participating organizations. During the first cohort, Astra Zeneca, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and Zenseact participate as hosts. Read more about Sahlgrenska University Hospital and what value they see in Eye for AI here.\n\nMaster Thesis Program \nDuring this spring, 28 students are working on 15 master thesis projects together with partners Chalmers University of Technology, CEVT, Embedl, Recorded Future, Region Västra Götaland, Scaleout, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Unibap, and Volvo.\nDuring 2022, the program will expand to reach more partners and universities all over Sweden."}

AI Sweden is inviting partners who need international top talents to become host organizations for the second cohort of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra Carrasco Limeros and Sylwia Majchrowska, during a meeting with director of the Hospital and dermatologist Ann-Marie Wennberg. Photo by Ines Sebalj in Sahlgrenska University Hospital magazine.\n\"The participants in the program do a lot of valuable work for us at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and at the same time, they bring us closer to AI Sweden’s other resources. Doing this together with other AI Sweden partners strengthens us as our differences build a program that is even more attractive to talent worldwide\" says Magnus Kjellberg at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, currently hosting talents from the first cohort. \nSahlgrenska University Hospital, SU, decided to join AstraZeneca and Zenseact as hosts for the first cohort of the international talent program for a couple of reasons. Attracting talent, getting support with specific projects – and helping build the AI ecosystem in Sweden and Gothenburg. \nA third of the way into the 18-month long program, Magnus Kjellberg, head of SU’s AI Competence Center, is pleased with the outcome and can recommend other partners to join as hosts for the upcoming cohorts.\n\"If you want to participate as a host organization, make sure you are well prepared. Plan what projects the participants should get involved in. That makes them feel welcome, and also builds the best possible environment to add value to the organization\" says Magnus Kjellberg.\nThat there is a global shortage of skills in artificial intelligence is no secret. Countries and organizations worldwide are competing to attract the best AI talent. By joining forces - AI Sweden, Zenseact, AstraZeneca, and SU - the hunt for talent went international. Ivana von Proschwitz, program manager at AI Sweden, explains the premise for the initiative:\n\"Eye for AI is a graduate program for future leaders in AI. We want to attract international AI talents to Sweden and put Sweden on the global AI map. The rotation scheme, where the participants will spend 6 months with each partner organization, is important because it allows them to get working experience from different industries and employers and hopefully find a future career within AI in Sweden\" says Program Manager Ivana von Proschwitz.\nOne goal for Magnus Kjellberg and his colleague Cecilia Hahn Berg, Life science strategist at SU, was to take that opportunity to showcase all the different kinds of AI applications within healthcare. \n\"Since SU is a university hospital that does a lot of clinical research, finding direct clinical use for AI is, of course, an important part of what we work with at AI Competence Center and also probably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about AI within healthcare\" says Magnus Kjellberg. \nBut good healthcare is not only about clinical practice. Additionally, there are a lot of supporting functions where AI can be applied for the benefit of the caretakers.\n\"At Sahlgrenska University Hospital, many administrative processes are also a perfect fit for AI. We are looking into how AI can be used to solve hard optimization problems such as in operating room management\" says Cecilia Hahn Berg. \nWe might not be able to compete with the most hyped employers when it comes to salaries and benefits. But if we can make it clear that there are very interesting and hard problems to work on at our hospital, for the benefit of both society and individuals, our hope is that we can attract really good talents\" says Magnus Kjellberg. \n\nSo far, the talent program has proven them right. During their first rotation, Sylwia Majchrowska and Sandra Carrasco have worked with SU on a few different tasks: Developing methods for dermatology, using both federated learning and synthetic data, is one. Exploring explainable AI, which is important to get doctors to trust the suggestions from an AI-based expert system, another. The third is multimodal analysis, where images and tabular data are merged and analyzed together. \n\"Thanks to them spending one day at AI Sweden every week, Sylwia and Sandra have also moved us a step closer to AI Sweden. We have got a natural connection to AI Sweden and all of the resources there. By participating in this program, we have been able to use the computing power in the Data Factory and recruit students who will do their master thesis together with SU\" says Magnus Kjellberg.\nCecilia Hahn Berg adds a third benefit from the participation: \"One important task for AI Competence Center is to support strategic decisions on what competences and resources we need in-house, and what shall be brought in externally. Through the program, we get a better overview of the Swedish AI landscape and by that, important knowledge into that process\" \n\n \nAll in all, it sounds like you would recommend other AI Sweden partners to participate in Eye for AI as hosting organizations?\n\"Absolutely! But you have to enter the program with the right mindset. Our hope is of course to find new talents to bring on as future employees. But we also see this as an important way to grow the AI ecosystem in Sweden in general and the western parts in particular. If we, together with AstraZeneca and Zenseact, can show the participants what we can offer, they will spread the word throughout their network. As long as the effect is that we can attract more AI competence to the region, it will benefit us all in the end\" says Cecilia Hahn Berg.\n \nDo you want to get involved?\nWe are looking for more partner organizations to host the next group of AI talent - do you want to be one of them? Then the Eye for AI program might be something for you!\nEye for AI is a unique 18-months program where AI talents from around the world are matched with 3 organizations and spend 6 months at each placement.

LAIban is an AI assistant who answers questions like what the children will have for lunch, who’s picking them up and when and suggests what clothes to wear when going outside to play. The children access LAIban via an iPad and it is currently used at about 40 preschools in Helsingborg City.\nStrategic key insights\nThe focus for the AI Ethics Lab discussions is not on how ethical issues are or should be regulated, but on what ethical aspects and additional perspectives should be considered in the implementation of the AI solution. \nThe following insights were derived from the group discussions, which used the presentation and use case mentioned above as a starting point. \nClarify what problem you want to solve\nAs with any innovative, new idea, ensuring that the solution you have in mind actually addresses a real-world problem is the first step. The issue that the AI solution aims to solve should be clearly defined and not taken for granted. This will give both developers and other stakeholders guidance when balancing risks against the value that the AI solution will bring. \nConsider the different target groups\nAn important part of the process of evaluating the ethical aspects of AI solutions is to bring in a variety of perspectives. One way of doing this is to consider the potential implications - both positive and negative - for the target groups in question. Looking at AI applications developed for toddlers, the primary target group is of course the children that will be using the AI solution. Their needs are paramount. But there are several other perspectives to keep in mind, and including those early on is key. Parents, teachers, school administration, local authorities and others all have a stake to consider. At times, the incentives for implementation or development may differ or even clash for different stakeholders. Understanding this will lay the basis for how to prioritize and move forward.\nSee the bigger picture\nImplementing a single solution is one thing - and another to envision it being used on a larger scale. What happens if the AI solution used in one preschool becomes the norm at all preschools in all of Sweden? It is likely that the positive effects found in the pilots will continue to be reinforced. Still, it is important to ask ourselves if societal preconceptions or boundaries may shift as a result. The theoretical concept of sociomateriality examines the social and physical aspects of introducing new technologies and becomes relevant in this particular case, in order to understand how a new generation of children will interpret a kindergarten using AI solutions on a daily basis.\nRead more about the AI Ethics Lab."}

One of the questions was if and when we could expect something similar for the Swedish language. The answer was that it would take a lot of data, a lot of computing power and a lot of collaboration. No estimate was made on how long it would take. Fifteen months later, GPT-SWE is now being presented. What have been the challenges along the way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of data cannot be understated. You need large quantities of high-quality data to train a good language model. For building really large models, you need significant amounts of data, which also need to be sufficiently clean. You also need access to powerful computer infrastructure to train really large models.\nThe current GPT-SWE model is trained on Linköpings University’s supercomputer, Berzelius using the Megatron framework from NVIDIA, which is specifically designed to optimally utilize the SuperPod architecture. This is important to reduce the training time of the model, which can otherwise become prohibitive.\nShow me the numbers! \nIt took close to 8500 GPU* hours on Berzelius, working with 106 GB of Swedish text as training data. Currently, the model has approximately 3.5 billion parameters.\nIs a language model of this size, in a small language like Swedish, unique?\nYes. There are no other billion-parameter model like GPT-SWE that have been presented for a language with a size similar to Swedish. Going forward, preparations are already underway to train an even larger model, with more data.\nThere are a lot of similarities between Swedish, Norwegian and Danish. What possibilities are there to train a Nordic language model?\nThat is something AI Sweden is looking into. We aim to train a significantly larger Nordic language model from data in all Nordic languages. Such a model would be able to handle all the Nordic languages, and would likely lead to improved performance for each of the individual languages, due to the variation present in the combined training data.\nWhen OpenAI presented GPT-3, there was a lot of discussion around ethical issues and potential malicious use cases. How is this addressed for GPT-SWE?\nGenerative language models are specifically designed to generate language. Of course, this means that they can be used for any generative scenario, including the generation of controversial and even harmful content. Language models also learn any artifacts present in the data, such as human biases, prejudice, and the lack of representativity of certain demographic groups. We are well aware of these potential problems, and therefore exercise caution in how we handle and apply the model. This is also the main reason why we are not at this time releasing the model openly; although the goal is to provide access to the model openly to researchers, and to host the model for commercial applications. \nAll this is fascinating, but help me understand how this can be useful in everyday life.\nAs the size of the model grows, it will become more competent in tasks like text classification, grammar correction, question answering, summarization, translation, idea generation, information extraction, and much more. The general applicability of large language models is sometimes referred to as “zero-shot” capacity, which means that the model can solve tasks even without being specifically trained for the task. This type of generalized capacity correlates with model size, which is the main reason for our ambition to train really large models.\nZero-shot capacity?\nThat means that the model can take instructions in natural language, like “Write a news article about AI,” “What’s climate change?” or even “Fix bugs in the following code,” and generate a text as output. Since text is used in all sectors, in all different kinds of ways, technology that makes this possible will have a high impact in terms of what’s possible, how long it will take and what it will cost. \nWhich organizations have been working on GPT-SWE?\nSo far, it’s been a collaboration between AI Sweden and RISE.\nI would like to know more about GPT-SWE. Who can I contact?\nIf your question is more on the technical side, get in touch with Magnus Sahlgren, Head of Research, Natural Language Understanding at AI Sweden.

Based on the same technical principles as the much-discussed GPT-3, GPT-SWE will help Swedish organizations build language applications not previously possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is GPT-SWE?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. GPT-SWE is the first truly large-scale generative language model for the Swedish language.\nWhat is a “generative language model”?\nIn AI, generative models are models that can create new data. There are also discriminative models, which can be used to tell apart different data points. So a generative language model is a model that can create text in human language.\nAre there other generative language models around?\nYes, for sure. Last year, OpenAI’s GPT-3 created a lot of buzz around the world. Within and outside the AI community, people were amazed by what GPT-3 could do. Examples ranged from writing poetry and generating HTML code to answering philosophical questions on the meaning of life. \nWhy do generative language models matter?\nThe early GPT-based models we see now are the first steps towards a world where you can talk to a computer in natural language and get instantaneous output that would normally require you to hire experts. In concrete terms, with these first models, you will be able to do summarization, classification, and other text-related tasks that you can formulate in natural languageーwithout spending a lot of money on annotating data and training new models.\nBefore GPT-3 there was GPT-2, and it’s not a wild guess that there is a GPT-4 in the works. Why do we need a GPT-SWE?\nGPT-SWE has been trained specifically to generate Swedish text. While a lot of what computers do is generally applicable around the world regardless of which country you are in, with language models, things are different. \nEach human language needs its own language models. The more widely a language is used, the more interest there is in it from the research community and private companies.\nThis means that we cannot expect the international community to provide a large-scale model for Swedish. We need to do this ourselves."}

That means there is no need for agreements around data sharing, no risks around compliance, no need for complicated access control setups, etc.” says Mats Nordlund, Head of AI Sweden’s Data Factory.\nHe continues, “We have built the Data Factory as an open environment where it’s possible to work together on projects that are pre-competitive, sometimes close to basic research. Since nothing done in the Data Factory is protected by IP rights, it makes it possible for competitors to join forces and learn together.”\nWith open datasets shared by AI Sweden’s partners, sometimes functioning as proxy data for various kinds of applications, the Data Factory paves the way for fast innovation. \nEbba Josefson Lindqvist, project manager at Data Factory, explains, “A lot is going on around data and data regulation at the moment. There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding GDPR. One option is to work with the legal aspects first and then, when that part is settled, start the actual technical development. But thanks to proxy data, you can work in parallel. While your legal team is looking into the regulatory questions, the developers can start their part by using proxy data.”\nWhat makes the Data Factory such a strong offering?\n“The mix,” says Ebba Josefson Lindqvist. “The Data Factory isn’t technology or data. It is technology and data. Also, the cumulative power of all the organizations working in the Data Factory sharing their knowledge openly and freely. From partner to partner, and from AI Sweden to our partners.”\n \nThis is AI Sweden’s Data Factory\nThe Data Factory consists of three pillars:1. Training environment\nA world-class, high-impact scientific center of excellence extending the forefront of distributed solutions to train AI algorithms.\n2. Testbed\nWhere it’s possible to test new frameworks, new hardware, etc. An important part is the Edge Lab, a physical infrastructure for the development of solutions based on federated learning and edge computing.\n\n3.

Inside AI Sweden’s Data Factory, Zenseact has used a dataset from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences to speed up important R&D work by 6-12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMina Alibeigi works as an AI Researcher in Zenseact’s Technology and Collaboration Team. Zenseact is developing a software platform for autonomous driving. A lot of Mina’s time is spent on research and proof-of-concept projects, i.e. demonstrating that state-of-the-art methods or ideas have practical potential. This is often done in collaboration with universities or startup companies.\nWhen building autonomous vehicles, “federated learning,” i.e. training an algorithm across multiple decentralized devices or servers, without exchanging locally stored data samples, plays a crucial role. \nMina points out, “With federated learning, there is less need to move data from one point to another. Instead, you train models locally at the same location as the data. These local models can be shared with fewer regulatory challenges, and then combined into a common global working model. So, for Zenseact, federated learning is an important technology. We can, for example, train models in one country without moving the data across borders.” \nNonetheless, there are still data challenges even when training models in a federated way. Mina Alibeigi and her colleagues at Zenseact have access to autonomous driving data which can’t be shared freely in R&D projects with external partners. Even within Zenseact’s organization, there are regulatory hurdles to overcome when you want to move raw data and non-trained models between borders.\n“So, we started to examine if we could use proxy data during our R&D phase,” says Mina Alibeigi.\n\n \nProxy data are datasets that share a lot of the same features of the data related to the solution you are aiming to build, minus the regulatory aspects of the data.\nIn this specific case, video recordings of seabirds, breeding on the cliffs of Stora Karlsö off the coast of Gotland, Sweden, turned out to be a perfect match for Zenseact’s needs. \nEbba Josefson Lindqvist, project manager at AI Sweden’s Data Factory, explains, “The dataset was part of a project called FedBird, where we worked with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences to help their researchers build a model to annotate birds in video material.”\nWhen working on other projects in the Data Factory, Mina Alibeigi saw similarities between road data and bird data. She realized the value that could be gained by experimenting with the FedBird dataset in Zenseact’s R&D methods and activities.\n“For one thing, the FedBird data is real-world data, not synthetic. Also, the challenges related to the bird dataset are like the ones we need to address in developing solutions for autonomous driving; for example, variations in light conditions, and differences in the birds' appearance are like differences between pedestrians. The dataset being split in two, one larger and one smaller, was also valuable to us, since we can’t get access to the same amount of data from all countries around the world.“\nThere are also two important differences between road data and bird data. There is no GDPR regulating the privacy of seabirds and there are no business secrets hidden in the “proxy” seabird data. \n“Once we realized that we could use the FedBird dataset that was available in AI Sweden’s Data Factory, we could start working with our partners straight away. I estimate that the FedBird data gave us between a 6 to 12-month head start, compared to waiting for clearance on the real-world road data.”\n\n\nHow do you reuse your work with proxy data in actual implementations?\n“We rarely use work based on proxy data directly in our production models or other code. Instead, it’s the knowledge and learnings we gain from working with the proxy data, often in collaboration with others, that speed things up.”\n \nMina Alibeigi, AI Researcher at Zenseact.\n \n\nMina Alibeigi’s advice on working with proxy data\n1. Develop an understanding of what proxy data is and the benefits it can bring, for example, faster development times, easier collaboration with other organizations and the possibility to build different solutions based on the same shared dataset. \n2. Find datasets that are representative of the challenges you have in the actual dataset your models are going to use. Without these similarities between the real data and the proxy data, it will be hard to draw any generalized conclusions from the work with the proxy data.\n3. Find organizations to collaborate with. Share knowledge with each other and/or benchmark different solutions’ results. \nFurther read\n→ Working with proxy data in Data Factory\n→ The Baltic Seabird dataset"}

In fact, digitalisation and the application of AI cuts right through society and impacts everything from jobs to education to welfare. How the new technology is used determines the society we get. With the Future of Democracy Summit, we want to get leaders from authorities, companies and interest groups to take responsibility for digital development and the future of our society,” says \nAmong the participants are well-known profiles and leaders including Dr. Mouna Esmaeilzadeh, Carl Bildt, Maria Mindhammar (Director General of the Swedish Public Employment Service), Archbishop Antje Jackelén and Microsoft Sweden's CEO, Helene Barnekow. In total, about a hundred decision-makers from business, academia, the public sector and civil society will participate in the talks on October 20-21.\nHélène Barnekow, CEO Microsoft Sweden, says, “Today, digital development is absolutely crucial for the development of society. For me, it is all about the interplay between people, technology and policy development. Sweden has been early in adopting new technologies and we have made a name for ourselves as an innovative country, for example when it comes to rolling out broadband and the investments made in the Swedish startup scene. However, we can’t rely on our past merits. Instead, we have to constantly look and move forward. Digital development doesn’t wait for anyone. At the Future of Democracy Summit, I’m looking forward to exciting talks and developing concrete plans on how we ensure digitalisation and harness  innovative technology to contribute to building a sustainable and competitive Sweden. A strong democracy for our time.”\nArchbishop Antje Jackélen says, “Sweden is celebrating 100 years of democracy and we like to see ourselves as role models in many ways. However, we are also credulous when it comes to democracy. We assume that it is rock solid. But it must be conquered again and again and, at the same time, constantly fed with values ​​- some of which will always be rooted in religious traditions. Democracy is ephemeral. I look forward to discussing this at the Future of Democracy Summit.”\nThe initiators of Future of Democracy are Media & Democracy and AI Sweden. The project has been developed in collaboration with the Committee for a Strong Democracy, the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences, International Youth Think Tank, Swedish Agency for Digital Government, Lindholmen Science Park, University of Gothenburg, Region Västra Götaland, Malmö University and Telenor.\nHere, you can read more about the Future of Democracy Summit in Gothenburg on October 20-21.\nPlease contact Carl-Martin Vikingsson if you have questions, or want to get in touch with any of the participants."}

Together, IMY and AI Sweden will identify recurring issues relating to data protection and AI. They will also highlight how support and guidance can be provided, and then also provide support and guidance on these issues.\n“Contributing to sustainable innovation and development by providing guidance and support to actors in the innovation system is an important part of IMY's strategic direction for the coming years. The collaboration with AI Sweden is an important step in that work,” says Karin Lönnheden, Chief of Staff at IMY.\nAI Sweden, together with partners, is very active in developing solutions to the legal issues that arise in handling data for applying and developing AI. An example of this is the established network, Legal Expert Group, where lawyers from some of AI Sweden's partners are given the opportunity to meet and discuss various legal issues and challenges linked to, among other things, AI and data protection.\n“Several of our partners testify that there are many challenges regarding GDPR, not least regarding the interpretation of the legislation and, for example, the assessment regarding the meaning of anonymisation. We are very pleased about the collaboration we are now initiating with IMY and the opportunities it creates to accelerate the application of AI in Sweden,” says Martin Svensson, Co-Director AI Sweden\nIMY and AI Sweden will jointly implement efforts to provide support and guidance regarding the legal issues identified.

It is co-authored by 13 senior experts from various fields. Among the authors is Markus Lingman, chief physician, strategist and member of the hospital management team at Region Halland and Halland Hospital. Markus was named AI Swede of the Year 2020.\nThe handbook describes proven data-driven solutions relating to areas such as regulations, personal integrity, leadership, etc. that work in clinical practice and which can create value for the patient. The handbook is based on the experiences of healthcare leaders who have already gone through an AI implementation process and, thanks to their shared learnings and insights, others will not have to make the same mistakes or reinvent the wheel!\n“To provide the care that people expect and should receive, we need to use data in new ways. We need to strive for individualized precision healthcare and to prevent diseases before they escalate. This transformation reduces both suffering and resource needs. But it requires leadership, decisiveness, coordination and the ability to predict risks. This is where AI comes into the picture. A handbook for information-driven healthcare describes in a concrete way how healthcare can be developed by harnessing the power of AI. The handbook should be mandatory reading for healthcare staff and decision makers,” says Markus Lingman, Chief Physician, Strategist and member of the management team at Region Halland and Halland Hospital.\nJohanna Bergman, Head of Project Portfolio at AI Sweden says, “AI Sweden's mission is to accelerate the use of AI with the aim of strengthening Swedish society, competitiveness and increasing the quality of life for all people who live here. Transforming the Swedish healthcare system so that it offers more information-driven, personalized and scalable care with the support of AI is therefore a highly important strategic initiative. The outcome is that healthcare resources are made more efficient and the working environment for healthcare staff is improved. In the long run, this improves people’s health.

The main target group for training in AI is what Tove Johansson, Learning Program Manager at Volvo Group University, calls \"the average engineer\".\n\"They are engineers who work in other areas than AI and data analytics specifically, but who need to understand how AI can become a tool in their day-to-day work,\" says Tove Johansson.\nVolvo Group University is a center for learning and competence development that is easily accessible to all employees within the Volvo Group. As Volvo Group is one of the partners of AI Sweden, it was natural for Tove Johansson and her colleagues at Volvo Group University to turn to AI Sweden to look for support and resources in AI Sweden's partner offering Training and Learning. \nAI in practice, Deep-Dive Sessions for Data Scientists, and AI-introduction for leaders are three examples from AI Sweden's offering that we use at Volvo Group. There is also a significant value in the events that provide knowledge and insights on a specific topic.\nNormally, Volvo Group University creates internal training material based on knowledge and skills among employees. However, as Tove explains, in the case of AI training, it was not as straightforward.\"We find the people internally with the right skill set and create a team with a writer and an editor. But since we, like almost everyone else, are short on AI competence, we had to find another solution in this area. Our employees with AI skills are needed to build things. There is no time for them to train their colleagues. That is why partnering with AI Sweden on this is so valuable for us.\"\nFor the most basic introduction to AI, Volvo Group University has an internal learning module with examples of AI implementations from different parts of the group.\nWhat are the biggest challenges when planning upskilling within AI?\"AI is an area that moves so fast, it's hard to keep up. That makes it difficult to understand what kind of training and learning is needed in which parts of the organization. Right now we are looking into AI Sweden’s new AI Maturity Assessment Tool to help with that.\"\nIn recent years, training and learning has changed. Courses that spanned a whole day or more are now more often much shorter where smaller chunks of knowledge are spread out over weeks and months. With digitalization, an individual's specific needs can also be addressed in new ways.\nRaquel Sanchez, Acting Head of Training at AI Sweden, says that working together with AI Sweden’s partner is crucial: \"Our partners can influence what's in AI Sweden's training offering in different ways, and also learn from each other. Going forward, we see that both AI Sweden's consultancy and academic partners can help build the training and learning resources that are needed. Already today, we have plenty of very exciting courses and trainings to take part of, so make sure to check them out!\"\nTraining and learning\nFor more information, please contact Raquel Sanchez"}

To strengthen Sweden's attractiveness in the area, AI Sweden, together with three partner organizations, is launching the Eye for AI talent program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEye for AI is AI Sweden's new initiative for international talent attraction. The program just launched together with three partners, AstraZeneca, Zenseact, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital. International top talents are recruited to an 18 months long program with the  goal that the participants will stay in Sweden.\n– Eye for AI is a graduate program for future leaders in AI. We want to attract international AI talents to Sweden, and put Sweden on the global AI map, says Program Manager Ivana von Proschwitz.\nAI Sweden teams up with three partners for an attractive opportunity: Each participant in the program will spend 6 months at each partner organization, working on real assignments with the help from mentors at both the hosting partners and AI Sweden.\n– The rotation between the three partners is important because it gives the participants the opportunity to get working experience from different industries and employers and hopefully find a future career within AI in Sweden, says Ivana von Proschwitz.\nOne day per week will be spent at AI Sweden for the participants to network with each other and become a part of the Swedish AI ecosystem. The program is developed together with Women in AI Sweden to recruit a diverse talent pool and to use the network as a sounding board when creating an attractive offer to the participants. Time spent at AI Sweden will also include training of language and cultural skills.\n– From the work we have done in Women and AI, we know that working with exciting projects, corporate values and leadership are really important when moving to a new country - salary is not the only thing that attracts talent and we want to show our talents the benefits of working in Sweden, says Ivana von Proschwitz.\n– With Eye for AI we get the opportunity to recruit AI talents who otherwise perhaps wouldn't have thought of Sahlgrenska as a potential employer, says Cecilia Hahn Berg, strategist for life sciences and AI at Sahlgrenska University Hospital.\n\n– Data Science and AI are already starting to make an impact on how we discover and develop medicines. We want to bring the best talent to our R&D strategic centres, including Gothenberg. The Eye for AI program is a unique opportunity to attract the best early in their careers.” Nina Mian, Head of Data Science Learning & Development in Data Sciences and AI at AstraZeneca.\n– By participating in Eye for AI, we can work with talents who bring international perspectives and ideas, while supporting them in their own development and building a career here in Sweden, says Mats Nordlund, Director of research and special projects at Zenseact.\nThe first Eye for AI cohort is a pilot run of the program and starts in October 2021. In early 2022 the recruitment process for the next cohort will start and will be open to top talents world wide.

In a recent global survey from Morning Consult, 43 percent of 5,500 businesses said that their rollout of AI has been accelerated by the pandemic. The top reason for not moving even faster? A lack of available AI competence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the US, AI-related job postings increased from 25,000 in the last quarter of 2020 to 37,000 in the first quarter of 2021. \nMoreover, 85 percent of the international students going to the USA for an AI related Ph.D. program are still residing in the country five years after graduation. This creates a brain drain from Sweden and the EU to the US, and nations inevitably compete with each other to attract AI talent. In addition, the lack of talent also spurs competition between employers.\nSo how do organizations address this problem? In two ways: Recruiting externally and retraining internally. \nBut being an attractive employer is about more than the job opening itself. When Women in AI in Sweden conducted a market survey on the preferences of international talent, wage was just one of the factors. Other important aspects were the values of the recruiting organization as well as the professional challenges offered in the employment.  \nAI Sweden has just launched three new initiatives to address the challenges and attract AI talent to Sweden.

The case study discussions resulted in five strategic insights that will guide future efforts in supporting the implementation of ethical AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of checklists and guidelines for trustworthy and ethical AI have been produced by both public decision-making bodies, industry and academic institution, in an attempt to address ethical aspects with AI. However, implementing these guidelines and putting them into practice often proves to be a challenge. The AI Sweden Ethics Lab was launched with the aim to help move AI ethics in Sweden from abstract guidelines to practical application.\nThe focus for the AI Ethics Lab discussions is not on how ethical issues are or should be regulated, but on which ethical aspects and additional perspectives that should be considered in the implementation of the AI solution. \nThe first meeting at the end of May 2021 resulted in a five strategic insights that will help guide future efforts in supporting the implementation of ethical AI.  \nPurpose is fundamental but not everything\nThe purpose and intended use of the AI solution is a strong guiding factor as to how to decide on ethical issues. Tracking young people’s use of gaming apps might be laudable if the intention is to alert the system to overuse, but not if the end goal is to encourage addiction. However, in reality it is not always feasible to constantly keep the purpose in mind during the development process when multiple smaller, but important, ethical-oriented decisions are made by a larger team.\nA multi-disciplinary approach is needed\nDiverse teams are often mentioned as a solution to discovering unwanted bias that a more homogenous team might not capture or test for. However, the discussions here showed that although diversity based on personal attributes is important, such as gender balance in AI developing teams, we need to shift our focus to disciplinary diversity. Bringing in for example behavioral social scientists or sociologists in AI development will have a direct effect. Not only for understanding of how algorithms may produce undesirable results, but for a wider understanding of the effect on society as a whole. What are the behavioral shifts triggered by the use of algorithm-based solutions by new users, target groups or in a new context?\nKnowledge gap between management and developers\nIn order to make strategic decisions about how and when to use AI, ethics need to be considered and well understood. Consequently, knowledge and awareness about AI and ethics needs to be present in organizations also on a management level. But this understanding still needs to be grounded in the reality of AI developing teams for it to be effective. A good understanding of AI will be a prerequisite for this and should be encouraged.\nGetting the AI developing community on board is key\nEthics need to be a factor when developing AI solutions. However, in reality, pragmatism and beating state of the art often takes precedence. Simply put, there is a tradeoff between performance and ethics. Developing teams should have the support and incentives needed to navigate these tradeoffs. Getting the AI community on board with the importance of ethics will be key for organizations to dare to challenge the current state of often favoring performance.\nWe need to work on both a short-term and a long-term timeline\nAI ethics is a huge field. The legal perspective, policies, and standards aside, there are still many issues to address in order to get one step closer to implementing AI ethics in practice. It is clear from the discussions that we need to entertain several timelines at the same time. Certain topics, such as introducing non-technical competence into AI development teams to diversify the disciplinary knowledge will take time. Still, AI developers are already today confronted with ethical dilemmas on a daily basis and getting access to the right tools and support structures is fundamental and should be made a priority right here, right now. These two perspectives are not mutually exclusive and should both be addressed, although with different timelines and target groups in mind.\nRead more about the AI Ethics Lab and its members here."}

Each track will be coordinated by a partner organization and all partners are now welcome to participate and/or take lead on one or several tracks.\n1. Legal analysis\nWhat does the proposal for regulation mean in legal terms?\nPartners with an interest in this track can:\nLearn from each other and share interpretations of the proposal\nCollaborate in the analysis of the proposal\nDevelop a summary of relevant legal interpretations of the proposal and summarize this in a report.\n2. Mapping practical consequences \nIn its current form, what practical consequences will the proposal have for operations in organizations as well as for customers and citizens?\nPartners with an interest in this track will together develop a list of examples of how the proposal would affect operations as well as citizens and customers. Positive or negative.\n3. Input to the policy process\nHow can partners cooperate in providing input to the legislative process and the policy being developed?\nPartners interested in this track can explore what common activities are desired and work to make sure that decision-makers have all the relevant knowledge and expertise at hand.\nPartners are of course encouraged to participate in all the tracks, and may choose to involve different persons for each track. The next steps include identifying which partners will take a lead on each track, and the work will continue in the individual tracks before all participating partners will reconvene to share progress and results in mid/late September.\nPlease reach out to Mikael Ljungblom at mikael.ljungblom@ai.se for any questions or to express interest in participating, preferably before the 11th of June."}

If you ask Felix Stollenwerk that question, the answer is \"yes\". As data scientist at Arbetsförmedlingen, The Swedish Public Employment Service, he builds applications that both help individuals and provides a better understanding of the labor market at large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most people, Arbetsförmedlingen's role is to help job seekers get a new job. But Arbetsförmedlingen is also the expert authority on everything related to the labor market. In both areas, language models play an increasingly important role. \nHelping job seekers finding a job is about making 1-to-1 matching, finding jobs that fit the job seeker's skill set. By doing a 1-to-many analysis, comparing an individual to the job market at large, it's also possible to estimate the 'distance' between a job seeker and the labor market. Based on that analysis it's possible to suggest what courses or other supporting activities a job seeker could benefit from. \nFinally, by doing many-to-many comparisons between both job seekers and employers, Arbetsförmedlingen gets the insights needed to understand the labor market as a system. \nFor all of these, the 1-to-1, the 1-to-many, and the many-to-many, the data available is unstructured text. \n\"The problem with unstructured text is that different people use different words to describe the same thing. Or that they use the same word, but in a different context. This means that simple keyword matching isn't enough,\" says Felix Stollenwerk, data scientist at Arbetsförmedlingen. \nThis is where NLP, natural language processing, becomes interesting for Felix and his colleagues. With the help of NLP, it's possible to go beyond the word-by-word comparisons between different texts and instead have software that in some sense also understands the context for how a word is used. \n\"We use NLP to create what we call Annotated Job Ads, where we add a metadata layer to the unstructured text. For this, we use what's called named entity recognition,\" says Felix Stollenwerk.\nNamed entity recognition, NER, is a variant of NLP where the software can decide what words in a text represents a job title, the required skills etcetera. \n\"Take 'mathematics' as one example. In a job ad, it can be used to describe different things. It could be a required skill, it could be a part of the company description, or that some of the colleagues are mathematicians. This is why words must be considered in the context to be meaningful, and a match between mathematics as a skill and mathematics as a requirement hint at a job opening suitable for someone who has a background in math.\" \nTo Felix Stollenwerk and his colleagues, the AI Sweden-led project Swedish Language Models for Authorities plays an important role. \n\"This field is moving extremely fast at the moment, the evolution over only the last few years is huge. In this fast-moving world, cooperation between organizations is essential. What everyone needs are data and competence. But not every organization has enough of both. By coming together, we can pool resources in a way that benefits everyone. Thanks to Swedish Language Models for Authorities, we have access to leading researchers at Peltarion and RISE and access to early releases of state-of-the-art models, as two examples,\" says Felix Stollenwerk."}

Language models presented after 2018 are now being described as transformative rather than a mere linear evolution. \"With Language Models for Swedish Authorities, we want to make sure that the public sector utilizes the latest and the very best language models available,\" says Magnus Sahlgren, researcher at RISE and also AI Sweden's Research Lead Applied Language Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you apply language models at the right place in an authority, you can use the technology for increased efficiency or better service to the public,\" says Magnus Sahlgren. \n\nA triage system for incoming e-mails that the Swedish Tax Agency has built serves as an example:\n\"The Swedish Tax Agency receive many questions from citizens and need efficient ways to direct each question to the right employee. But not every e-mail is explicit about the topic, this means that simple keyword-based rules aren’t sufficient.\"\n\nThis is why 2018 is an important year. Magnus Sahlgren describes the key difference before and after 2018 as \"contextual understanding\". Up until then, a technology called word embeddings had made semantic search and similar applications possible. \n\"With semantic search, you don't only get results matching the exact word you entered in the search field, but also synonyms. But word embeddings don't understand the context in which a word is used. It can't tell the color orange apart from the fruit or the company or the US county,\" says Magnus Sahlgren.\nThe breakthrough in 2018 was the transformer models. This was a new kind of machine learning algorithm that understood the context as well. With these transformer models, the foundation for a whole new kind of applications is available. Like the Tax Agency's e-mail triage. \n\"For an authority like The Swedish Public Employment Service, you can build applications that not only use specific words like 'painter', but in some sense understands the meaning of being a painter.\"\nWith the transformer models in place, it also became possible to do what's called \"transfer learning\". Based on a general Swedish language model, transfer learning makes it easier than before to create a new, more niche model for specific applications. \n\"The best generic language models we have in Sweden are the ones developed by The National Library of Sweden. They have the biggest generic language model in Swedish just around the corner. Fed with examples for a specific domain, new models can be built on top of that. It's like when a child has learned to walk, it can learn to run, to tip-toe and to do a crazy walk.\"\nWhat role do the Language Models for Swedish Authorities play in this ecosystem? \n\"Within the project, we have a unique mix of participants. With AI Sweden as the central hub, we have the National Library's data, models, and competence and RISE's leading research on algorithms. And the participating authorities bring their use cases and expertise. I would say that the results we get wouldn't be possible otherwise.\"\nIf you represent an authority that hasn't joined the project yet, what would be the first steps? \"Sit down and think about what value language models can bring to the organization. Don't approach it like an innovation project, where you want to build a chatbot. Start with the organization's pain point. If you find a lot of text data there, it's probably a possible application for language models. If that's the case, get in touch with us and you'll get an invitation to an upcoming reference group meeting. There you can present your use case, and we will take it from there. Quite possible, there are already other participating authorities that have similar challenges.\"\nWhy a project for Swedish authorities and not just a general project for Swedish language models? \"Because the public sector has a much more explicit need for great language models in Swedish. The private sector often has an international reach. For the public sector, it is also important that the models are trained on a data set that is as representative of the Swedish language as possible. Having the National Library of Sweden as a project member makes sure that that's the case. But the results from the project are available to everyone.\"\nLearn more about AI Sweden's strategic program on Applied Language Technologies here.\nDo you want to know more about Language Models for Swedish Authorities?

This means that the data that is currently used for training algorithms used for medical diagnosis risks being prejudiced, and that the AI solutions even reinforce this bias over time. For example, skin cancer-detecting algorithms risk being less accurate when used on dark-skinned patients, since they are trained on fair-skinned images.\nIn an attempt to address ethical aspects such as this, a number of checklists and guidelines for trustworthy and ethical AI have been produced by both public decision-making bodies, industry and academic institutions. However, implementing these guidelines and putting them into practice often proves to be a challenge. AI Sweden is therefore launching the Swedish AI Ethics Lab with the aim to help move AI ethics in Sweden from abstract guidelines to practical application. \nThe members that have been appointed as part of this group are as follows\nAnna Nordell Westling, Sana Labs\nDaniel Akenine, Microsoft\nEvelina Anttila, Peltarion\nHelena Thybell, Save the Children\nKatarina Gidlund, Mid Sweden University\nLouise Callenberg, PublicInsight\nMagnus Boman, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Karolinska Institutet\nMartin Engström, Region Halland\nSara Övreby, Google\nStefan Larsson, Lund University\nTheodor Andersson, Agency for Digital Government\n“AI ethics is gaining increasing attention, and for good reasons. At AI Sweden we already address many issues, such as privacy and fairness, in a number of our applied AI projects. But we see the need for an even more directed effort, and our partners echo this need. \nI am therefore very happy to be joined by a very competent group of individuals in discussing ethics in AI development. Their diverse experiences range from global corporations and startups to the public healthcare sector and non-profit childrens’ rights. Bringing together AI expertise with sociological, legal and theological perspectives, combined with knowledge from both the public and private sector, makes for a fresh take on the discussions”, says Daniel Gillblad, AI Sweden\nThe purpose of the Swedish AI Ethics Lab is to provide guidance and support in implementing ethics in AI development, and will be piloted during the course of 2021. Over time, a growing library of AI ethics use cases will provide private businesses, public organizations and policy makers in Sweden with a tangible go-to source for how to approach - or not approach - their own projects. \nFor questions, please contact Karin Vajta Engström, project manager for the AI Ethics Lab, at karin.vajta@ai.se"}

Diagnosing cancer. Driving cars. Even defeating grandmaster Go-players. There has also been a huge number of reports on AI's potential, calculated in numbers like BNP growth or possible savings. But to unleash this potential, we need to look at more than data and the technical aspects of AI - the whole organization needs to change. Conny Svensson shares thoughts on how to achieve this and what AI Transformation at AI Sweden looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– All these examples inspire people to dream and fantasize: \"What if we could use AI for this! Or for that!\" And there is a huge potential in AI – but most organisations are still a long way from making it a reality, says Conny Svensson, Head of AI Transformation at AI Sweden.\nWhile many organizations have hired data scientists and built a few prototypes, Conny Svensson's experience is that things stop there, with a proof-of-concept that's never implemented.\n– The problem is that AI often is approached from a technical angle. One has understood that AI is this powerful new thing and feel an urge to do something with it. What's often lacking is an idea on what this \"something\" is, says Conny Svensson.\nInstead of taking the technology as the launch pad, take a step back and think about the pain point in the organisation. Which are those? Could AI help address them? Here, a proof-of-concept isn't enough. Conny Svensson prefers to talk about PoVs, proof-of-value.\nWhat the value is will of course depend on the organization. It could be more money in the bank, removing dangerous steps in a production process, better public sector services to the citizens, etc. The important thing is that a PoV doesn't only focus on the technology – the data and the algorithms – but the value created by the use of technology.\nAI isn't just plain old digitalization\n\"Digitalization\" has been on the agenda for at least the two last decades. AI is a part of that, but at the same time a different kind of beast.\n– I've been working with ICT and digitalization since mid-90. Nothing has changed an organisation like AI does. When mobility was everyone's top priority, we didn't talk about ethics and moral, about top-management's understanding of the technology or other topics surrounding AI. Mobility was about bringing the organisation's website to a smaller screen, something that could be seen as a traditional business case and run as an ordinary IT project.\nAI can very broadly be described as a new toolset for analyzing enormous volumes of data. Where the human brain has evolved to simplify and filter out information, AI can instead draw conclusions from all available data. This means that AI can help us both ask and answer new kinds of questions. And based on the answers have new kind of insights.\nAI Sweden's new offering: AI Transformation\n– There are lots of great courses and trainings for people who want to become data scientists or learn to code machine learning solutions. But there are too few initiatives helping the domain experts and management team understanding what AI is and how it can be applied in their work, says Conny Svensson and continues:\n– With our new offering AI Transformation, AI Sweden wants to support our partner organizations to realize what questions AI can ask. For every organization, this will differ depending on what their goals are and how far on their AI journey they've come.\nThe idea is based on a process called Lean AI Transformation, being both agile and iterative in its nature. In each of the five steps – Assess, Dream, Plan, Change and Scale – AI Sweden will have offerings that can help the partner organizations on their transformation journey.\n– One example is a self-assessment tool developed by German AppliedAI, part of UnternehmerTUM. In May, AI Sweden will launch a Swedish adaptation of that, as an online service that any organization can use. That will help in the first step, the Assess phase.\nAnother example is a use case library, where AI Sweden will collect good examples on applied AI, useful for the Dream phase. What have others done? What would something similar look like in our organization?\nThroughout all five steps, there is also a need for sharing experiences and learning from others. Here, a broad offering around training and education is an important part of AI Sweden's offering. This includes, among other things, possibilities like the 45 minute AI introduction for leaders, the AI Change Agent Program and the masterclass AI for leaders. For those who are into podcasts, there is AI för CxO:er & ledare. And, at AI Transformation Day in mid-April, AI Sweden will launch a new partner offering: A new type of network, where partners will meet for roundtable discussion once every month.\n– The overarching goal is to help our partners work with mindset, leadership and curiosity. Supporting what we call the AI Change Agents in our partners' organizations is an important part of AI Sweden's mission. And what we do in AI Transformation is the practical part of that mission, Conny Svensson concludes.\nSo where to start that journey? Listen to the AI för CxO:er-podcast, make sure to attend at AI Transformation Day and if you haven't been through any AI training yet, start with the free course Elements of AI, suggests Conny Svensson.\nBut he also has a challenge for you:\n– Before you do any of that, take some time and write down five opportunities you see in AI. And five things that worry you. While you listen to the pod, see if those things are part of the discussions, if your thoughts are validated or challenged, and what new associations and thoughts they inspire. Doing this will force you to think about AI, not only listen.\nIf you want to know more about AI Sweden's ideas on AI Transformation or are curious about how our AI Transformation team can help you?

For Boliden, AI is, among other things, a tool to help reduce the human footprint on the climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– When the world is being electrified, there is an increase in demand for copper. Inside a petrol car, there is around 20 kilograms of copper. Inside an electric car, there is 70 kilograms. To meet that increased demand in a safe way we need automation, says David Degerfeldt, Program Manager Artificial Intelligence in Mining at Boliden.\nThe first step is remote control. This allows operators on the ground to control the mining equipment deep down under the earth's surface. This is made possible in part by a 5G network inside Boliden's mines.\n– The second step is using AI and other technologies to make the machinery fully autonomous. We hope this will result in less wear on the machines, and at the same time also increase the production to the level that's needed.\nIn a presentation given at a webinar arranged by Swedish Mining Innovation, David Degerfeldt recently referred to Global Mining Guidelines Group's (GMG) Maturity Model. The company is currently at the second level out of five, at the one GMG calls the Foundation.\n– We have understood AI's potential and done our first case studies, about both predictive maintenance and predicting disturbances, says David Degerfeldt and adds:\n– The later case was the more successful one. We could predict disturbances up to two hours before they happened by using AI. Implemented in production, that would be very beneficial because it would give the operators ample time to take precautionary actions and hopefully avoid the problem.\nGoing forward, David Degerfeldt's goal is to build a company-wide acceptance for AI and how it can be applied within Boliden. The over-arching vision is a data-driven Boliden.\n– We have a lot of work to do to build that acceptance and understanding. Making data available and using it for our decision making is a good starting point, I think. And when the data volumes grow, the need for AI will come.\nAs one example, David Degerfeldt mentions a project based on reinforcement learning on one of the primary mills in Aitik.\n– Training the model on our simulation of the mill revealed that it would take 200 years before the models would perform better than the controller we use today – if the model was trained on real-world data from the mills. That highlights why simulations are so important: You want to use the technology where it makes an acutal difference, and by training the models on simulations you can get there faster.\nIn the end, David Degerfeldt is certain that AI will have a great impact on how Boliden operates, and by that also on how the company is organized. When the toolset changes, the competences needed change as well.\n– For a long time, our heroes have been down in our mines. When our machinery is controlled remotely, and eventually fully automated, we will have new heroes in new positions.\nWhy has Boliden decided to join AI Sweden as a partner?\n– We hope that AI Sweden can help the whole industry to move faster and further in this journey. It is to complicated for any individual company to make the transformation on its own. AI Sweden has an important role in coordinating and connecting all great intiatives both withing the private sector and academia."}

The program comprises a number of projects, use cases, and testbed facilities. The goal of the strategic program is to create a platform to explore and develop new solutions including federated learning to address challenges around how to transfer information - instead of raw data - in an efficient and secure way. New team members Ather Gattami and Mats Nordlund share some of their thoughts for the strategic program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMats points out that data is often born on the edge, for example in devices that may be in your pocket, or equipment in a manufacturing system, or sensors in your car. Using traditional methods, the data is transferred to a central location in order to train the algorithms. Transferring a lot of data to a central location has a lot of challenges:\n“Consider the data generated at a hospital. This is very valuable, but in many cases it cannot be shared with other hospitals for privacy reasons. In other applications, we collect huge amounts of data, but the transfer and storage costs make it challenging to move all this data to a cloud or a central storage and compute location. Both these scenarios beg the simple question - can we have the cake and eat it too? Decentralized AI may be the answer. How do we share knowledge and insights without transferring the data.”\nAther, who is taking a leading research role in AI Sweden’s newly formed strategic program in Decentralized AI, says that this program marks an important step to address these challenges. \n“In order to fully accelerate the use of AI we need to operationalize the outcomes and learnings from individual, collaborative projects so that they can be used at a larger scale. AI Sweden is therefore moving from managing a portfolio of individual projects to developing a number of dedicated strategic programs, one of these is Decentralized AI. These programs will leverage each other and drive the use of results, learnings, data, methods, and best practices to many partners. Decentralized AI is in its infancy and at AI Sweden we want to become world leaders in developing this technology based on applied research conducted in partnership with our partners who will benefit from the technology.”\nMats explains that one of the spearhead initiatives within the program is the Edge Lab that was opened earlier this year. The Edge Lab is part of the Data Factory testbed facilities and lets industry partners come together to innovate around edge learning:\n“With partners such as Volvo Cars, Ericsson, HPE, Zenseact and CGit providing expertise and infrastructure, the Edge Lab is at the absolute forefront of edge learning. In addition to supporting organizations in Sweden to benefit from this new technology, we also invite leading international industry and academic partners to this lab.”\nConcluding, Ather underlines that the Decentralized AI program addresses real-world challenges. “It has a strong commitment from partners in both the public and private sector. The unique setup and broad partnership enable us to contribute to the field at a global level. From an applied research perspective, we will focus on identifying solutions to common challenges, that have the potential to accelerate the use of decentralized machine learning for increased competitiveness in many different organizations and sectors.”\n \nWant to know more or contribute with projects, data or competence?\nRead more here\nFor research-related questions contact Ather: ather.gattami@ai.se\nFor questions related to the Data Factory, contact Mats: mats.nordlund@ai.se"}

But the most powerful and popular language models are currently based on English and Chinese. This points to the need for developing robust Swedish language models to ensure that Sweden strengthens its competitiveness and can keep up with delivering high quality welfare to its citizens. \nTo accelerate innovation, development of applications and implementation in this area, Applied Language Technology therefore constitutes one of AI Sweden’s new strategic programs.

At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the main tools for powerful social change. Still, little effort has so far been made to combine the two or understand the impact AI can have on combating carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is why AI Sweden, RISE and Stockholm Resilience Center have produced the report “AI in the service of the climate”.

The report, which was funded by Vinnova, introduces a number of AI solutions ranging from climate research and monitoring, to initiatives for emission reductions, climate adaptation, and innovation and transformation. Moreover, Sweden could take the lead internationally. \nAlthough there are ongoing discussions around the world about how to use AI in combating climate change, there is currently no official initiative combining the two. It has therefore become evident that Sweden has great potential to take a lead on this also internationally, says Erik Wilson, project manager at AI Sweden. \n\n\n \nSweden needs to invest in existing structures to allow AI, climate and sustainability expertise to collaborate and drive innovation. The biggest obstacle to applying AI to the climate challenge in Sweden today is that there is no bridge between AI and climate expertise, as well as a lack of financial resources and collaborative platforms.\n \n\n\"AI has the potential to strengthen both Sweden's competitiveness and our welfare, and it is clear that also our climate has much to gain from powerful AI solutions.

Could you tell us a bit about what you will be doing in your new role?\nThank you, and yes of course! The overarching mission for AI Sweden is to accelerate the use of AI nation-wide. We do this in close collaboration with our partners and have identified three key areas where organizations need to excel in order to gain maximum reward from their AI initiatives. First, relevant and high-quality data and infrastructure provides an important basis for any AI project. We meet this need at AI Sweden through our Data Factory and its testbed initiatives, such as Edge Lab. On top of this, AI expertise and technology is required, an area often led by data scientists or similar AI specific roles. At AI Sweden we successfully run a number of strategic programs and have a project portfolio that focuses on applied AI. Last but not least, a focus on business and user understanding will be crucial to accelerate AI. In essence this is about having the right mindset, competence and willingness to change. This is what we call AI Transformation and is where I will spend most of my time.\nCould you tell us more about what value you want to bring to partners?\nFor an AI project to succeed it needs to solve a real need for the business or the users it serves. AI can and will change processes at the core and this requires strong leadership, a good strategy and transformational thinking. AI Sweden will therefore place an even larger emphasis these issues and increase our support for partners in AI Transformation.\nMany reports and studies show that the biggest reason AI or data driven initiatives fail is not technology based but related to people and culture. For any change to succeed you need to apply new mindsets, new ways of working, new partnerships, new skills, new business models and transformed processes. This is especially true for a technology such as AI which has huge potential to increase business values, but that often requires changing existing processes at its very core. Applying AI to an existing area without making the necessary organizational and procedural changes is a common mistake. \nSo, what is needed to avoid making this mistake?\nHow to start and scale the AI transformation journey will look different depending on what culture, organization, operating model, legacy and business model you have today. At AI Sweden, we aim to collect common practices, tools, use cases, change and strategy advice as well as practical training to acquire new skills needed. \nData engineers and data scientists will remain key roles for any AI journey, however I will work on developing what it means to be an AI Change Agent. This is a person working in the intersection of people, business and AI, and will be crucial for organizations to succeed with their AI Transformation.\nHow do partners get in touch with you if they want to share their own experience or discuss any needs they might have?\nInput from our partners is very important – both in terms of what is needed today and what has worked so far. Please feel free to reach out to let me know about use cases, or even things that didn’t work out as expected! \nIf you want to come in contact with Conny to discuss this new area, AI Transformation, please contact him at conny.svensson@ai.se"}

The hackathon, which focuses on AI for Gender Equality, is an initiative launched by Vinnova, Nordic Innovation House Silicon Valley together with AI Sweden and Women in AI. Through an interactive and engaging sprint over the course of a week, we saw more than 80 people from 19 different countries join the community generating ideas, designing solutions, and creating future businesses around the six specific challenges.\nAfter a week of hacking the jury evaluated the ideas to pick three top finalists. The jury evaluated the teams and the potential of their solutions in four different areas: \n1. Value and impact for the intended user and society\n2. Creativity and innovation\n3. Feasibility\n4. Presentation of solutions\nOut of all the participants, three teams were selected: team pAIge, fAIR and Dometric.\nThese teams all got through to the final round where they got to live pitch at the final event of the hackathon. All of the teams had interesting and impactful solutions for promoting Gender Equality, but in the end there could only be one winner. And the winner of the event was Dometric - a solution to tackle the issue of unpaid domestic work with the motivation from the jury:\n“It was very invigorating to find an idea relating to the topic of unpaid work. We have seen in our previous work that there is a lack of ideas and products in this area and it also comes with a lot of challenges such as integrity aspects and risk of conflict around who is doing and not doing unpaid work. The presented solution has taken those aspects into account and presented an innovative solution that deserves to be taken further. An additional plus to this project is the pilot where the team has gathered sensor data and trained a model to identify different household activities. \nThe team exhibits good competence both in gender knowledge and gender analyses as well as data science which is an important part in order to succeed in the area of AI and gender equality.” Sophia Ivarsson, PhD Researcher, Gender and innovation expert at Vinnova\n\nBig congratulation to team Dometric and hackers Myky Tran, Alexandra Antgren, Jun Auh, Mimmi Thorneus, Sofia Wingren and Sara Thiringer.\nThank you also to the jury: \nHanan Salam, Researcher and founder of Women in AI.\nJosefine Olsson, Europe Future Tech Lead at Accenture.\nMikael Hagström, AI Expert.\nRikard Steiber, CEO at GoodTrust and President at HTC.\nSophia Ivarsson, PhD Researcher, Gender and innovation expert at Vinnova\nPeter Kurzwelly, Entrepreneur and startup manager at AI Sweden.\nThanks are also extended to the team organizing the hackathon from Vinnova, Nordic Innovation House in Silicon Valley, AI Sweden and Women in AI.\nIf you want to find out more, please visit http://ai.hactathon.se"}

We spoke with the Swedish team Backtick Technologies - one of the first external users of the dataset - to understand how they used the Space Data Lab and what solutions they came up with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow can satellite data be used to predict road conditions, even where there are no images? Backtick Technologies was one of the teams involved in the hackathon, aiming to answer this question. By combining satellite data with their own calculation models and linking this with road data, they were able to present a solution that in the future can contribute to creating both safer roads and more efficient road maintenance.\nBacktick Technologies, consisting of Oskar Handmark and Fredrik Olsson, managed to get all the way to the final and finished third place with their idea based on the hackathon's challenge \"Snow and Cloud Detection\". By combining satellite data with the geographical position of roads and other map data about the roads, the goal was to use their model ARCIF - Arctic Road Condition Indexing & Forecasts - to estimate the road conditions on all roads, even where there were no images.\nTo develop their idea, the team gained access to satellite data from Copernicus, as well as the Space Data Lab's OpenDataCube, and thus became some of the first external users of the platform.\n\nOskar Handmark and Fredrik Olsson, Backtick Technologies\nTell us about your idea?\nThe solution we chose to work with is a model we call ARCIF - Arctic Road Condition Indexing & Forecasts. The model identifies areas of snow / ice / clouds on satellite images. The idea was based on combining the results from this model with existing images from street view (Google, Mapillary) and image segmentation models for these images.\nTogether with the geographical position of the roads and other attributes such as their size, one can estimate the road conditions on all roads, even where there is not enough data. Since satellite photos have a relatively high resolution compared to street view data, it is possible to combine the time series it creates with weather forecasts to estimate the road conditions in the future.\n \nWe see a number of possible areas for this, including improved traffic safety, self-driving cars, resource prioritization (for maintenance, etc.) Analysis of accidents and Predictive maintenance\nDid it go as you hoped?\nIn general, we are satisfied with what we achieved during the hackathon. The model we implemented for identifying snow / ice / cloud areas worked very well (UNet structure with pre-trained encoder part. 91% pixel-wise accuracy) and our idea to use it for ARCIF felt interesting and useful.\nProbably the biggest challenge was the lack of annotated data for training and evaluation. Here we instead had to use data from certain satellite bands to construct annotated data for image segmentation. There was also a lack of sufficient amounts of street view data.\n\"Overall, it worked great to work with the Space Data Lab's OpenDataCube. The API was easy to use and together with the sample code provided by the hackathon, it was easy to get started and retrieve satellite data.\"\n\nThe only downside really was that it took quite a long time to retrieve image data. Therefore, we tried to save as much data on disk as possible, to be able to maximise the use of the graphics cards in the training phase.\nHackathons as catalysts for new solutions\nWithin the Swedish Space Data Lab project, hackathons are an important part of the development work, and involve a large group of potential users.\n\"Hackathons are not only very fun, but also an opportunity for new talent to get involved in a context where innovations become reality and a chance to try new ideas,\" says Viktor Lehtonen, Project Manager for the Swedish Space Data Lab.\n\n“It is also a way for us within the project to expand the user base and spread the knowledge about the data that is available within Copernicus. For many, satellite data is something completely new and we are happy to introduce it to more people. We already today see how satellite data is used in a number of different ways and in the future this will only increase, especially in combination with artificial intelligence.”\nOskar Handmark agrees. “It's amazing that the hackathon took place, otherwise we probably would not have started exploring use areas for satellite data as quickly. The Space Data Lab and the organizing parties are obvious partners in future projects, primarily as a catalyst for new services and applications.”\n“We have become very interested in satellite data and are currently investigating other use cases and product ideas and also plan to participate in a major hackathon (ActInSpace 2020) for similar ideas.“\n \nRead more about the methods behind Backtick Technologies' solution here. \n \nAbout Copernicus Hackathon\nThe Copernicus Hackathon was organized by Arctic Business and Innovatum Startup September 26-28, 2020, with a record number of participating teams from across Europe. A total of 58 teams from seven countries participated in the hackathon to find solutions to seven different challenges related to climate change, life on land and COVID-19. The teams gained access to satellite data from Copernicus, which was made available through the Swedish Space Data Lab, among others.\nThe solutions were evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: Relevance to the topic, project interest and team quality.\nThe winning team was awarded with 20,000 SEK and a place in Copernicus Accelerator went to the team WaterFinders, based in Germany and Italy.\n\nRead more about Copernicus Hackathon Sweden \nView the winning presentation here."}

The winning solution and its algorithm will be used to help AstraZeneca accelerate the drug development process. But the foundation of it all, allowing AstraZeneca to make its data available for the challenge, was AI Sweden's Data Factory. Solving the necessary legal requirements as well as providing world-class compute power, the Data Factory was a key factor behind the success of the challenge as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Factory provides a legal and technical framework for AI Sweden's partners to donate and gain access to data, as well as to use storage and compute power for AI projects. The data that the teams analyzed for the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge was donated by AstraZeneca and consisted of a multitude of cell images.\nOne tool commonly used to develop systems for targeted drugs is high-resolution microscopy. Changes in cell structures are analyzed to assess the effect of different types of drugs. In order for the microscope to be able to differentiate between different cell structures in the cell images, it is required to first preprocess the cells. This is both time consuming and costly. In addition, the preprocessing can affect the cells, which interferes with the end result and makes it difficult to collect reliable data over time, for example when studying the effect of drug intake over a longer period of time. \nThis is where machine learning and the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge comes into the picture. Eight teams of Swedish and international representatives from both academia and the private sector participated in the challenge. The task was to use machine learning to accelerate the drug development process by sidestepping the need to preprocess the cells. \n“We at AstraZeneca will be able to benefit from the results from the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge immediately. Our partnership with AI Sweden and the teams’ contributions have opened up for both new ideas and new collaborations. It will help us leapfrog the production process, increase our capacity and potentially bring new drugs to the market even quicker.” -Anders Holmén, Vice President and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences IMED, AstraZeneca\n\n\nAlan Sabirsh, Principal Scientist at AstraZeneca, explained that one of the driving factors for AstraZeneca to share their data with AI Sweden and the Data Factory for the hackathon is that the success of AI solutions is often proportional to the quality of the data. Finding efficient and innovative ways to work with data and increase the quality is therefore key. \nThe winning team, HASTE team, consisted of researchers from Uppsala University and was selected by a jury consisting of representatives from AstraZeneca, Vinnova and AI Sweden. Their solution uses machine learning to analyze the grayscale images of cells that are not preprocessed. They used a technology that focuses on collecting data points to create an overview of the cell structure, while specifically searching for information about the cell's core, so-called privileged information. Thanks to this, it is possible to skip the preprocessing of cells and immediately gain an understanding of how the cell is structured and reacts to new drugs.\n“The main advantage that Data Factory offered us was its ability to train models with a much higher speed. Running on the A100 GPU approximately halved our training time and helped us try novel ideas quickly. Working with Data Factory was a true privilege for us as machine learning researchers. As dataset sizes and model capacities grow larger, Data Factory becomes more and more relevant to use for any data scientist.” -Ankit Gupta, Uppsala University and member of the winning HASTE team\n\nSheetal Reddy, data scientist at AI Sweden and one of the organisers behind the challenge, underlined that Data Factory provides the best GPU available on the market. She explained that it is container based, so that partners can come up with their own packages and still be supported by Data Factory. “Data Factory’s compute power is state of the art and ensures stability and reliability when running extensive deep learning models, allowing partners to experiment fast,” she says. She stressed that the solutions that all teams came up with were excellent and that it is great to now see the potential for further collaboration.\nAstraZeneca echoed the importance of partnership, and Alan Sabirsh emphasized that they look forward to collaborating with several of the participating teams going forward. “The Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge has given us new avenues for collaboration and we will implement the solutions in our research - it was really impressive,” Sabirsh explains.\nThe data that the teams analyzed for the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge is now available for AI Sweden's partners and several of the teams will continue to collaborate and learn from each other’s solutions while working in the Data Factory. The codes and reports from the hackathon are also available open source on GitHub. \nRead more about the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge.\nListen to Alan Sabirsh introduce the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge in more detail during the AI Sweden Partner Week.\nContact Ebba Josefson Lindqvist to get involved or learn more about the Data Factory!\n\n\nProject Manager Data Factory\nEbba Josefson Lindqvist\n+46 (0)73- 254 29 03ebba.josefson@ai.se"}

One of the biggest takeaways was that, apart from the key components of data and technology, business, management and policymakers are absolutely crucial for a successful AI journey. Keep reading for a brief summary of what was discussed, or head to our YouTube channel and dive straight into the recorded stream if you want to check out a specific session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe Data Day\nOur first day together focused on data. Data has been hailed as the new oil, invaluable for its wealth of opportunities. But stepping away from the buzz - what is the real value of data, and why is it a crucial component for building our future? How do we make the most of it, and solve tangible challenges around access and sharing? \nMats Nordlund at Zenseact kicked us off with a presentation on why data is crucial and what new solutions are needed to transfer and store data on the edge. Following on from this, Alan Sabirsh from AstraZeneca shared an update on the Adipocyte Cell Imaging Challenge and highlighted that AI solutions are only as good as the data they use. Read more about the challenge here. Daniel Zakrisson, Scaleout, discussed what he called the “data access challenge”, that the most valuable data is also isolated and we therefore need new solutions for accessing and transferring it. \n“The most valuable companies today are based on data. It could be seen as the new oil -  but it is different in many ways. Data can be used many times and it becomes more valuable. You can also replicate data. There are downsides too. If you lose a batch of data it might be the end of the entire business. We like to put the data access challenge in relation to this.” Daniel Zakrisson, Scaleout\n\nFinally, Sergio Martin-del-Campo, Viking Analytics, held a presentation on the value of data before Alexandra Kukresh, Docusign, concluded with how to turn data into a trusted asset and increase its traceability. \nClick here to watch the recorded sessions from the Data Day!\nThe Tech Day\nDuring the second day of Partner Week, we shifted the conversation to Edge AI and federated learning. As edge devices are becoming increasingly powerful, the idea of applying AI at the data collection site is gaining a lot of traction. With Edge AI as the solution to key problems such as privacy, security, and latency, it is only expected that the future of AI will be a hybrid Cloud-Edge solution.\nOur first presentation of the day was by Hans Salomonsson at EmbeDL who, among other things, discussed the benefits of using Edge AI over Cloud AI, and efficient deep learning in embedded systems. Pier Luigi Dovesi at Univrses then continued by showcasing how using Edge AI and computer vision can transform traffic flows and how we move through cities. Another use case for edge processing of data was presented by Sofie Tressing at Zenseact who explained how it is used for autonomous vehicle fleets. \nClick here to watch the recorded sessions from the Tech Day!\nThe Business Day\nThe final day of Partner Week was all about AI transformation for business and management. Implementing AI solutions and understanding what strategies and transformations will be key may prove challenging no matter if you are at the beginning of your AI and digital journey or at the very forefront. Why is a strategic business approach crucial, and how do we overcome the challenges to benefit from the opportunities that come with a more holistic approach? \nAI strategies are probably not important - but having AI as a core to your business is crucial. It will be the driving force for every business in the future. Kye Andersson, AI Sweden\n\nKye Andersson and Daniel Gillblad, both AI Sweden, opened with a conversation on the need for AI strategies and the importance of engaging business, management and policymakers in the AI journey. This message was echoed by Sebastien Verchere, Volvo Group, who emphasized that Volvo Group does not have a specific strategy for AI, but that AI is listed in every element of the Volvo Group strategy. Moreover, he stated that the technical maturity of AI is on a good level, instead underlining the need to now focus on human beings and change management in order to proceed with implementing AI solutions. This message was reinforced further by Martin Svensson, AI Sweden, who finished off not only the Business Day but Partner Week as a full, by highlighting how AI Sweden supports the acceleration of AI.\nClick here to watch the recorded sessions from the Business Day!"}

This is a key component in facilitating Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications on a broad scale in Sweden, which in turn have the potential to positively impact many different kinds of professions; allowing for example health care personnel to focus on providing care instead of administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage models are the underlying algorithms of NLP applications. The performance of a language model is not only based on how well it has been trained to understand and perform its specified task. The data that the model has been trained on and how it affects the model is at least as important for our understanding of the results that we receive when applying the models. \nSpråkbanken at Gothenburg University, National Library of Sweden, RISE and AI Sweden have joined forces and received funding from Vinnova to start forming a national and standardised testbed, consisting of Swedish evaluation data. This will enable a better and common understanding of the language models that are being developed, and how they work. The collaboration is a key contribution to the national responsibility of facilitating the development of trustworthy and robust NLP applications.\nA Swedish version of (Super)GLUE\nMagnus Sahlgren, Head of Natural Language Processing Group at RISE, is the coordinator of the project, and explains that the project will further the development of Swedish NLP by taking the first step towards a Swedish evaluation framework.\n\n“The transformative breakthrough that Swedish NLP is undergoing right now - with the development and application of large-scale language models - gives completely new possibilities for the usage of NLP in Sweden. A precondition for this development to be viable and have its desirable effects, is that there is Swedish evaluation data available that can be used to judge and compare the quality of the models that are developed.” \nThe English original benchmarking platforms GLUE/SuperGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) consist of a set of language understanding tasks, enabling evaluation of language models with regards to both performance and bias. The tasks are for example used to evaluate and describe the degree of bias and prejudices that the model has learned from the underlying data. Another example is the 'word-in-context' task, which tells how well the model can understand different meanings of the same word, based on the context (homonyms). These tests are currently only adjusted for English language models, which is why they now will be developed for Swedish language models.\nKey project for the development of Swedish NLP\nA number of important initiatives are currently taking place in Sweden to develop and make available Swedish language models. The 'SuperLim' project is one of the latest contributions to these initiatives. AI Sweden’s co-director Daniel Gillblad emphasises the importance of developing the Swedish area within NLP;\n\n“A lot of the data that is necessary for us to build the future’s AI solutions consists of text and natural language. The language models that are needed to make use of this data have become a lot better in the recent couple of years, but we need to focus even more on the Swedish language. This project will result in better Swedish language models and smarter AI solutions for Sweden.” \n \nAs more and more organisations and companies start implementing NLP solutions specifically trained for assignments identified within their own organisation, the need of having a common way of describing the quality of the language models and how they work, will continue to grow. This project will lay an important foundation for that common understanding. \nRead more about the project here\nFacts: The project goes on until May 2021.

Teams can now apply for competing in an intense two-week challenge with the aim to predict the content of cell images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the drug development process, the uptake of drugs in cells is typically studied using a combination of brightfield- and fluorescence cellular imaging. Fluorescence imaging is needed to identify certain structures in the cells and requires the use of toxic staining techniques.\nThe task\nThe task is to utilize machine learning to combine the advantages of bright field and fluorescence imaging and at the same time avoid the toxic effects of cell labeling by predicting the content of the fluorescence images from the corresponding bright field images. \nIn this competition, we want the participants to utilize machine learning to accelerate the analysis of cellular imaging and potentially replace the potential cytotoxic fluorescence labeling step in the experiment. We hypothesize that it is possible to predict the content of the fluorescence image from the corresponding bright field images using deep learning.\n\nAnders Broo, Head of Data Science and Modelling at AstraZeneca\nDownload the complete problem formulation\nRead more!\n \nBackground\n\nNovel therapeutics and cell imaging\nHistorically, most drugs have been small molecules binding to target proteins in the body. The problem is that one drug might bind to several similar proteins, creating unwanted side effects. A more specific way is to target the RNA sequence of the proteins where nanomedicines often are used to transport RNA cargo through the body.  These nanomedicines are small engineered machines made from biomolecules that interact with cell membranes and machinery to deliver RNA into cells where it can affect their function. \nTo be able to inject the nanomedicines into the skin will make treatments with nanomedicines easier for patients. One of the most important cellular targets are the fat cells (adipocytes) that we all have in our skin. To avoid using human test subjects, adipocyte cell cultures can be created from stem cells. One of the most important methods to investigate the uptake of nanomedicines in cells is cell imaging, which is the topic of this challenge.\nThe goal of cell imaging is to extract relevant information about the cell structures that can guide pharmaceutical development. To permit imaging of different cell structures, fluorescence microscopy is used to label specific parts of the cell. \nThe adipocyte data set\nAstraZeneca is sharing a data set consisting of pictures of stem-cell derived human adipocyte cell cultures  The cells have been imaged, using a robotic confocal microscope, at three different magnifications, using both brightfield and fluorescence imaging.\nAfter the competition, the data set will be accessible for non-commercial purposes to all AI Sweden partners through the Data Factory.\nThis is a great example of how a collaborative mindset and new ways of working can accelerate applied AI in Sweden! In this competition AstraZeneca contributes with data and domain knowledge while AI Sweden provide computational resources and outreach to the AI community. \n\nJohanna Bergman, Head of Project Portfolio at AI Sweden. \nFacts:\nApplication is open, apply before October 15\nThe challenge will be held online starting on November 2\nTotal prize sum, sponsored by AstraZeneca is $5000\nMaximum number of team members is 5\nTeams will have access to computational infrastructure during the competition\n  For more information, please contact:\n Johanna Bergman\n Head of Project Portfolio\n +46(0)31-764 70 10\n johanna.bergman@ai.se"}

He is an acknowledged expert on AI, as well as a speaker who is much in demand. We talked to Göran about AI, the biggest problems and the areas with the greatest potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Founding Fellow of AI Sweden, Göran focuses on international relations, long-term strategy and democratic impact, and brings a significant contribution with his ideas, knowledge and extensive network. His focus areas are leadership and AI transformation. At the moment he is based in Washington DC where he acts as an advisor to private and public sector in North America and Europe that want to develop their businesses in the field of AI. \nWhat would you suggest to companies that want to take their first steps in the field of AI but haven’t (yet got) started?\nI think it’s a good idea to focus on the business aspects in the early stages and not to regard this so much as a technical development. You can begin by looking at the top priorities within your own management team and, on the basis of your requirements, act more quickly than other companies have done. That usually results in a more long-term approach.\nIt can be good to monitor the situation on a broad basis by focusing on what has been done in your own industry and in other sectors. As AI is a general purpose technology regarding for example pattern matching the finance industry can learn from the healthcare sector and vice versa. You should also look outside Sweden’s borders and see what other examples you can find. I also recommend focusing on core functions within the company at an early stage, rather than choosing areas on the periphery of the business. Often people want to experiment and try things out by having just the real enthusiasts working in the area to be safe. But it’s better to focus on something important because then you need what you’re doing to have an impact right from the start. The company management team must be committed and closely monitor projects rather than completely delegate responsibility.\nWhich industry is at the cutting edge in AI, apart from the tech sector?\nThe finance industry got off to a quick start and so did customer service. Legal practices have also done well so far. In the USA, small lawyers’ firms use AI to search through large volumes of data, for example. The retail sector has also made unexpectedly good progress. Another industry in a special position in this field is healthcare. In some areas of healthcare a lot has been achieved and in others hardly anything at all. Many healthcare organizations take an “organic” approach. That is, specialists starts testing AI as one possible tool in their work. This has been the mainstream approach in Sweden but it tends to take really long time to achieve anything. Some healthcare organizations in e.g. USA has taken a more strategic approach to AI. That is, the top management is involved on an almost daily basis and it often results in excellence centers within the organization. The latter is needed to support the different initiatives.\nPurely from the perspective of efficiency, which sectors will benefit from speeding up the development of AI?\nThe sectors that are of interest to me are for example urban planning, construction, local authorities and other similar areas. Here there is a lot of low-hanging fruit and a great deal can be achieved in a short time. In the public sector, including healthcare, a huge amount can be done right now. According to the report produced in January by the Swedish Agency for Digital Government (DIGG), Sweden is wasting around SEK 140 billion every year by not taking advantage of existing AI and by introducing it too slow. The Swedish healthcare sector has an enormous amount to learn from other countries. This is an area where we really should be speeding up the development of AI. Otherwise the answer to the question is really all industries. There is no industry that would not benefit significantly from introducing AI.\nHow can we resolve the skills mismatch between the companies that will benefit from AI, but know nothing about it, and the AI experts?\nI think that the people we describe as AI experts should take a more educational approach. They need to have a better understanding of businesses to be able to introduce the benefits. \nAnd another approach that I think works even better here in the USA is when business people and economists are brought in who know most about the company. If they learn the business perspective of AI, that is when I have found it simpler to solve the skills mismatch problem. When you can combine this mutual learning you probably get the very best result. \nYou are one of our Founding Fellows. What do you think you can bring to AI Sweden and our partners?\nI think I can add to the knowledge on how AI is used in different sectors and different parts of the world. I’m also familiar with the political objectives in different countries. More specifically, I’ve dealt with EU issues during the period I spent working in the Swedish Government Offices. I travel a lot in North America and Europe and I have an extensive network. I work closely with the Swedish public sector. I often meet executive teams to support their strategical work on AI. As a keynote speaker on AI I also meet many people which are new to AI."}

She believes that HPE’s extensive technical experience will be a great contribution in establishing the eco-system around AI Innovation of Sweden. “The ultimate goal is to make Sweden a leading nation in AI, it is critical not to fall behind in order for Swedish companies to stay competitive,” says Anna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) became an official partner of AI Innovation of Sweden in April this year. One of the first HPE initiatives was within the area of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).\nMLOps is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to efficiently manage AI in production. This initiative is set up as a collaboration together with AI Innovation of Sweden and its partner companies in order to learn, develop and test different solutions in this field. In addition, HPE contributes to the development of the national testbed for Data Factories at AI Innovation of Sweden. HPE leading researcher and Technology Fellow from HPE is a member of the international expert group, providing advice to the Data Factory project and several other senior technical experts from France, USA, and India are engaged in different initiatives at the Data Factory.\nPartnerships are part of our DNA and we are convinced that, to succeed, innovation must take place in a partnership characterized by openness where expertise and skills are brought together. \n\n“We believe that AI Innovation of Sweden is set up in a way that promotes collaboration and that is critical in order to be successful. Partnerships are part of our DNA and we are convinced that, to succeed, innovation must take place in a partnership characterized by openness where expertise and skills are brought together. We want to have a win-to-win setup,” says Anna Granö, Managing Director HPE Sweden.\nIn what way do you currently work with AI in your projects?\n\n“As a concrete example, we are working on AI in a project with Zenuity. Our technology and services help enable Zenuity to collect data from test cars and to transport data to where the data is to be analysed. This is to empower the developers of Zenuity to easily test and develop the AI software. It is essential to be able to handle data in a simple way and that is what we are doing in the project with Zenuity.”\nHPE is now heavily engaged in the planning of Data Factory 2021 architecture, orchestration and automations design (e.g., MLOps) to allow other partners to explore what they can do with this while giving valuable user feedback to HPE. Another example of an initiative is a project on distributed learning where HPE will participate. HPE’s first contribution in this project was an online seminar on “Swarm Learning” which was held on June 17 for all partners of AI Innovation of Sweden. At this seminar HPE showed their solution and what can be achieved. This is a critical initiative since it has the potential to solve a lot of the questions around data regulations, security and also ethics within AI.\nMats Nordlund, Acting Head of the Data Factory at AI Innovation of Sweden is positive:\n“HPE’s values closely matches AI Innovation of Sweden ́s vision to accelerate applied AI research and innovation through collaboration and cross-industry sharing. It is great to see how HPE, an innovation leader in the area of data factories, engages its experts from three continents with experts from us to further explore exciting applications and technology. We expect this to result in identifying new opportunities to develop additional functionality for future data factories which will be to the benefits of all partners of AI Innovation of Sweden.”\nMore about HPE"}

To be able to try something out, they need a complete infrastructure adapted for AI projects.\"\nAn infrastructure catering for various needs cannot be a one size fits all. When it comes to hardware, the Data Factory will enable partners to work with both on-premise solutions as well as cloud solutions. Both solutions have their advantages, in some cases, regulations require on-premise solution physically located in Sweden for an idea to leave the concept stage and go into experimentation.\nThe current Data Factory infrastructure is donated and hosted in the Gothenburg-area by our core technology partner CGit. It comprises one NVIDIA DGX-1, with a one Petaflop performance, 40 000+ cores, and an appropriate storage capability for large projects and datasets.\nLegal Expert group and Focus Group for Law\nThe datasets are equally important to get started on most AI journeys. Knowledge of legal frameworks, implications of technical solutions, as well as how to manage large and complex datasets, are high-demand resources in companies today. \nSeveral projects connected to the Data Factory have already been launched including the Road Data Lab, SCAPIS AI platform and the Swedish Medical Language Data Lab. In addition hackathons such as the Baltic Seabird Hackathon and Space Data hackathon have been hosted by AI Sweden.\nThe Data Factory functions as an access portal to large datasets, as a collaboration platform, as a compute resource, and as a knowledge repository.\n\"While we are continuously building on and expanding hardware and cloud solutions, we are also looking into and working to understand legal issues and develop use cases for how datasets can be applied and under various circumstances.\"\nTwo initiatives relating to legal issues are initiated; The Legal Expert Group and Focus Group Law.\nWe will extend an invitation to our partners to be part of a Legal Expert Group - a group comprising a smaller number of legal experts that will identify legal issues, discuss these and generate solutions and share their findings in for example, white papers or guidelines that could benefit all partners within AI Innovation of Sweden. \nWork within the second initiative, the Focus Group Law, has already started and here lawyers, researchers in law and others with an interest in legal questions are discussing these and suggesting initiatives or projects that AI Innovation of Sweden should run.\nFuture of the Data Factory\nData Factory is up and running but it will always remain a work in progress. Technology in this area is developing extremely fast and current solutions and knowledge will soon be outdated. This is the reason that this Data Factory is designated as a national testbed. The testbed capability will provide significant value to our partners and position AI Innovation of Sweden as an international benchmark of how to set up a highly valuable data factory.\nOpen for action\nToday, partners of AI Innovation of Sweden can use the Data Factory to:\nDonate datasets and models; use donated datasets and models\nDevelop and test models on datasets\nRun pilot projects within the organization or together with other partners\nRaise organizational know-how on how to set up and run a data factory of their own\nUse compute power and infrastructure to solve challenges e.g. through hackathons\nUse the Data Factory for research projects or master thesis student projects\nIf you are a partner and want to make use of any of the activities above, please reach out.\nMore about the Data Factory"}

MAQS joined us in April and is already up and running and actively collaborating with us. “Becoming a partner of AI Innovation of Sweden means new possibilities for us to stay updated on the latest developments, keeping an ear to the ground to identify trends at an early stage within our business”, says Anton Olsson, lawyer and partner at MAQS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the legal structure for the Data Factory at AI Innovation of Sweden is being built, with a focus on the necessary agreements and policies enabling partners to share datasets and models within the AI projects. We are therefore creating a group of legal experts and a focus group for law regarding, for example, data sharing, GDPR and intellectual property law related to AI. \nSharing knowledge and experience on legal issues, gained from projects and collaborations, will also get great attention moving forward. This will elevate the general knowledge on how to handle data sharing in a compliant way. The connection between legal and technical issues is vital for creating common opportunities to run AI projects. \n“Law is an aspect that must be taken into consideration in relation to most of the issues that come up to discussion when we deal with AI. Integrity and the GDPR is one important aspect, but there are several more. The partnership with AI Innovation of Sweden is the perfect way for us to take part in the conversation. It will enable us to identify and handle issues at an early stage and support the stakeholders. You have to test ideas on the legal framework continuously and our experience is that today we join projects at an earlier stage than we did 5-10 years ago, which is a very positive development”, says Linn Samuelsson, lawyer and partner at MAQS. \n”What we do today, we have to live with for many years. So if we miss an aspect now, there might be limitations later on on how to use for example a dataset. We want to embrace technology instead of being afraid of it”, adds her colleague Anton Olsson. \nOutlooks \nMAQS will be one of the partners in the Data Factory group of Legal Experts. They will work on trying to establish legal guidelines where there are no precedents. They will for example look into the difficult legal issues relating to data sharing and algorithms. \n“Having MAQS join us as a partner is fantastic. We are now in the process of defining some very interesting legal issues regarding data sharing, for example in relation to GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) so the timing for MAQS to join couldn’t be better”, says Ebba Josefson Lindqvist, Project manager of AI Innovation of Sweden ́s Data Factory. \nWe look forward to working with MAQS on both the long term legal questions as well as short term and foresee that MAQS’s assistance will bring great help in making the Data Factory an efficient testbed for partners in their AI projects. We have exciting times ahead of us as we are now preparing the next level of our Data Factory."}

One of the projects starting up is the \"Test bed for AI-driven language learning”, which will be run by the City of Helsingborg's labour market administration in collaboration with AI Innovation of Sweden, Get AI, Lund Faculty of Engineering, Lund University and Lingio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage is key to integration and inclusion\nSweden faces major challenges in integrating new immigrants, and one of the most important areas is to ensure that more people join the workforce. \nOne of the main obstacles for foreign-born people to gaining access to Swedish society and the labour market is knowledge of the Swedish language. For foreign-born women, the situation is even more difficult, as they are less active in society. This means that in many cases they miss out on important language development and thus risk increasing exclusion and an increased risk of isolation, health issues and dependency on government benefits. \nAI enables learning based on the student's own requirements\nA number of training initiatives are currently in progress throughout the country for the specific purpose of strengthening knowledge of the Swedish language, and the intention for the preparation project ”Test bed for AI-driven language learning\" is to take the next step and see how better results can be achieved and language learning accelerated by creating training tools that are individually adapted. The project will have an additional focus on investigating how an AI-based teaching system can include the women who, for various reasons, do not participate in regular SFI teaching.\nHenriikka Airaskorpi, Head of Operations for adult education, City of Helsingborg, sees numerous opportunities in the future solutions:\n”Using AI as part of language training is a very exciting opportunity for those of us working in adult education. Our adult students want to be able to use the Swedish language outside of school and there is great potential in being able to develop AI solutions so that our students can talk regardless of the time and place.” \n \nIsabelle Johansson, project manager at AI Innovation of Sweden adds:  \n“This is an application where the personal benefit of AI is very clear. This means that we have the opportunity to tailor the training to the individual's level of knowledge and requirements. This could, for example, take place with support systems that give feedback on the user's pronunciation or words requiring additional practice.“\nThe project will start in May and continue through to December. During this period, the focus will be on investigating and mapping the requirements. The test bed will then be constructed in a virtual environment and include a digital infrastructure where the city gathers data from relevant domains and platforms. \nRead more about the project\n \nFacts:\nThe project is financed by Vinnova through their call for \"Test beds to address society's challenges\". Project partners: Arbetsmarknadsförvaltningen Helsingborgs stad, AI Innovation of Sweden, Get AI, Lunds Tekniska Högskola, Lunds universitet and Lingio."}

This was documented on video over a long period of time and the preliminary results are now in: “We understand that the behavior of the birds is a lot more complex than we previously thought,” says Jonas, scientist from SLU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research study​ was based on filming the guillemots for 2,000 hours on a cliff at ​Stora Karlsö on Gotland in the spring of 2019 in order to acquire knowledge about the sensitive ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. All the data collected was analysed by several teams at the hackathon. The guillemots that are high up in the food chain revealed a lot in their behaviour, such as particular disorders and needs. ​\nWe talked to Jonas Hentati-Sundberg, ​a scientist​ from SLU, who participated and produced the video material together with WWF. He explains that they have been focusing on two elements since then, one of which concerns the scientific use of the methods that were formulated by the teams. They are working intensively with this and have been tweaking the algorithms. The second element is to develop citizens’ own scientific ideas, which means that general observers can offer their individual interpretations.\n\nJonas says that the filmed material is open to the general public to study:\n“One of the tasks of the hackathon was to formulate an interface to make it more enjoyable and more attractive for the general public to interact with our researchers to acquire knowledge about the birds. We have a live stream on our website which anyone can view in order to see the birds bickering, gathering food and other activities. We use the data that comes in to help AI to develop.”\nHe goes on to say that the results they have discerned to date reveal that the behaviour of the birds is much more complex than previously thought:\n\"We’ve been able to realise this by starting out with much more data material than was previously possible. Earlier, we observed ​a​ bird shelf for ​one​ day and calculated the result using average values, but now we can follow individuals at a detailed level which gives us a completely different understanding. In the past, we could see how things decreased or increased, for example how many fish were brought onto the shelf, but soon we’ll be able to see how things develop over time and analyse the results.\"\nWhat is the outlook for the future? What could this lead to in the long term?\n\"It is beyond doubt that this technology will help us to understand new dimensions of the life of the birds. I’ve been studying these birds for close to 20 years. We receive a wealth of information about the behaviour of the birds every minute, and we can link things together, see individual variations and the impacts they have. If a storm should blow up for example! What happens then? We can see everything.\"\n\"One challenge we still face is the demanding analysis work of the video recordings. Several months of filming is required to get a few weeks’ worth of material, but faster technology means that we get immediate feedback which generates a plethora of questions. \"\nThe hackathon not only resulted in valuable data being collected, but also in a new recruit for AI Innovation of Sweden’s team. Sheetal Reddy, with a background as a research engineer at Siemens, is AI Innovation of Sweden’s new data scientist as of a few weeks ago. Sheetal was part of the winning team from the hackathon, who will now be focusing primarily on the Datafactory project.\nRead more about the hackathon here"}

For society and for industries. And journalism and the media are no exception. Data and AI-based technology are growing in importance for innovation and development. What opportunities and challenges does this pose to the news media?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a focus on the future, AI Innovation of Sweden and the research and innovation programme, Media & Democracy, have jointly launched a pilot initiative together with a number of media groups. The goal is to establish and accelerate media-related, applied innovation focusing specifically on AI and data-driven journalism, business, product/production and distribution development.\nThe media operators will lead preliminary studies and projects in partnerships, and will also have the opportunity to participate in other cross-sector initiatives. “Our assessment and hope is that this investment will have a substantial impact on the innovation capacity of the media industry over time,” says Martin Holmberg, Programme Manager for Media & Democracy.\n“It can be painful to accept”\nThe majority of media companies are already applying AI and automation in some form or other. But the scope varies. Examples include algorithms that prioritise and personalise websites and news feeds. Similarly, robots write and publish template journalism in “data-rich” areas such as finance and sports. AI can also be applied for other ongoing work such as image processing, editing, and research.\nDaniel Nordström, editor-in-chief at Västmanland County newspaper, explained during the “AI and Journalism” seminar at Lindholmen Science Park in October 2019 that for Mittmedia, algorithms have proven to be more successful than editors when it comes to curating the home pages of the majority of news websites.“It can be painful to swallow and accept, but these are exactly the results we're seeing”.\n“It can be painful to swallow and accept, but these are exactly the results we're seeing”.\n\nVisitors are consuming more features, more digital subscriptions are being signed and fewer are being cancelled. The latter in particular, that is reducing customer losses, is a very high priority for the commercially financed news companies. When the supporting advertising business greatly diminishes, the focus is then put on digital media business as a matter of survival. “Great interest is being shown in how media houses can develop their use of data and AI technology. But working with more data and AI drives calls for new knowledge, new ways of working and new thought patterns, including reflection,” says Martin Holmberg.\n\nMore forward-looking journalism\nFor journalism, more elements of data analytics and AI functionality could initiate a pronounced shift from more retrospective reporting to more forward-looking journalism. Having the tools and processes at your disposal for a completely new way of analysing and identifying patterns in large amounts of information is of great potential benefit for research and new journalistic approaches and services.\n“Trust is a core value for the news media. That's why this example of questions and parameters is crucial to media companies when it comes to developing AI solutions. \n\nAt the same time, the new technology helps to identify new challenges. In addition to fundamental and major trust issues in terms of ethics and publishing, regulations, integrity and source protection, etc., data and new technology are also being used to promote disinformation and propagate fake news, which could have major consequences for society and democracy.\n“Trust is a core value for the news media. That's why this example of questions and parameters is crucial to media companies when it comes to developing AI solutions. Transparency is a vital ingredient,” affirms Martin Holmberg.\nRead more about the project\n \nAbout the project Period: December 2019 - June 2021Participants: Media & Democracy, Hall Media, Stampen Media, Sveriges Television and AI Innovation of Sweden.Funding: The initiative is financed by Vinnova and the participating companies."}

Josefine Rembsgård, legal coordinator at AI Innovation of Sweden, has looked at how legal challenges are associated with collaborative projects within AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the collaborative projects carried out at the Data Factory at AI Innovation of Sweden, legal requirements often take centre stage. They involve questions relating to ownership of data, legal responsibility, and, not lastly, personal integrity.\n\"These are questions that generally affect everyone who works on collaborative projects within AI in one way or another, regardless of sector or professional role, so it's important that they're emphasised, \n\nIn order to increase knowledge within this area, Josefine Rembsgård, legal coordinator at AI Innovation of Sweden, conducted a preliminary study during the summer and autumn of 2019 mapping the legal challenges that selected participants perceive as being the greatest with regards to the implementation of collaborative projects within AI. The preliminary study also addresses perceived limitations and conditions in order to share data.\n\n\"These are questions that generally affect everyone who works on collaborative projects within AI in one way or another, regardless of sector or professional role, so it's important that they're emphasised, \"  Josefine explains and continues;\n\"Since it also involves many questions that can be considered as being relatively new, there are challenges in how to handle them\"\n \n \nPersonal integrity is one of the greatest challenges\nOne of the greatest challenges that is highlighted in the preliminary study report is the legal questions associated with the General Data Protection Regulation, the GDPR.\nThe questions that are emphasised include how the legislation should be interpreted and the consequences of not having enough support regarding interpretation from relevant authorities. Other challenges that has been identified is that the legislation can be considered as having limiting effects, as well as questions about how data may be collected.\nOther questions that have emerged are: Where is it possible to access reliable data? Who is responsible for ensuring that the data satisfies a certain level of quality? And what does anonymisation entail concretely according to the legislation?\nThe importance of education and cross-disciplinary knowledge\nThe preliminary study also stresses important challenges relating to the need for pedagogy and mediation when several different parties intend to collaborate and understand each other in order to find solutions to legal questions. The need to work with a more cross-disciplinary approach is also stressed so that people with different areas of expertise can understand each other and learn from each other. For example, there is a great deal to gain when legal and technical experts work in close proximity to each other.\nJosefine agrees:\"I think pedagogy, in particular, is incredibly important in collaborative projects in order to prevent misunderstandings in general, and especially so that the parties can understand what legal questions they face and how to solve them.\n\"By also taking a more cross-disciplinary approach to work and sharing knowledge, we can learn important lessons for future projects.\"\n\n\"In order to avoid the perception that the law is an obstacle and something difficult, I think that it should be a fundamental part of collaborative projects from the very beginning in order to structure the project and also include teams that are experts in these different questions. By also taking a more cross-disciplinary approach to work and sharing knowledge, we can learn important lessons for future projects.\"\nImportant to set the legal framework from the very beginning\nIn order to investigate the legal conditions, a great deal of work is required at the start of the AI projects that are implemented at the Data Factory. It concerns terms and conditions for sharing of data, how data will be used in the project, the purpose of the use and by whom it will be used. The responsibility for personal integrity is of greatest importance, particularly in relation to the data sets that are sensitive in nature, such as medical data. In addition, the partners' individual conditions must be determined and the legal requirements established in preparation for the collaboration. These requirements must then be included in agreements.\n\"It's incredibly exciting to be able to participate and follow the different types of collaborative projects, and how the parties greatly improve in collaborating to solve these common challenges. By trying to highlight perceived problems, we're able to more easily address the questions and find answers together, and this preliminary study is an attempt to do just that,\" Josefine concludes.                                            \nThe preliminary study report constitutes an objective overall summary of what the participating representatives from partner companies have raised during each interview.

Our two Space Data Lab pilot projects are now testing how satellite data can be used to improve how we monitor and prepare for these changes. The first of these projects assesses ground humidity in relation to the risk of forest fires. The second project monitors increased vegetation and overgrowth at Lake Vänern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the autumn the National Space Data Lab has worked towards the development of a so-called “data cube” using two different pilot applications: \"Climate adaptation data cubes\" for Mälardalen and Lake Vänern.\nThese aim to test how to perform integrations that are based on the data cube and how these could be used to make available satellite data that is sourced from external parties. \nThe point of departure for these projects has been based on satellite data that has been collected and supplemented with an interface and data analysis, and used to develop applications.\nClimate adaptation data cube, Mälardalen\nThe pilot focuses on measuring ground humidity to predict forest fires, which would have been useful during the summer of 2018 where large areas of forest in Västmanland were destroyed by fire. This is essential in view of the fact that the number of days with low ground humidity and a consequential high risk of fires is likely to increase in the future because of climate change. \nThe pilot that has been developed aims to identify potential areas where there is a risk of fires and, for example, announce outdoor grilling bans in good time, increase water reserves reservoirs. It also allows us to track the damage that is caused by fires. The primary users of the application will be Västmanland county administrative board and insurance companies as a basis for customer risk assessment. \nThe working group on the Mälardalen pilot was comprised of: Rise and Västmanland county administrative board.\n\nClimate adaptation data cube, Lake Vänern\nThe second pilot project has focused on the state of Lake Vänern with respect to water levels, vegetation and green regeneration. As increasing numbers of open beach areas are becoming overgrown with small trees and bushes, we need to monitor how fast and where overgrowth is becoming a problem in order to identify the locations that need to be maintained. We are able to use the satellite data from the application to see how the changes occur over time. We can also use machine learning to train the application how to recognise areas that will soon become overgrown.\nThe working group of the Lake Vänern pilot was comprised of: Västra Götalands länsstyrelse, Rise, Metria and Space Agency\nAbout the National Space Data Lab\nThe aim of the Space Data Lab is to increase the use of space data to progress our society, to develop our industry and to make the Earth a better place. It will serve as a national resource for the Swedish authorities in their work on Earth observation data and the development of AI-based space data analysis. The objective is to establish the data, technology and methods that will be required towards the systematic development of services and applications that are based on space data, here at the Space Data Lab.\nThe project is funded by Vinnova and operates in partnership with the Swedish Space Agency (Rymdstyrelsen), AI innovation of Sweden, Luleå Technical University and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. \nRead more about the Swedish Space Data Lab"}

Three media companies are on board from day one: Hall Media, Stampen Media and Sveriges Television. - We're very happy about the initiative, says Martin Holmberg, Programme Manager at Medier & Demokrati.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that is gaining increasing importance for innovation and development. The media industry is no exception and the initiative promotes collaboration between media companies and AI Innovation of Sweden with Medier & Demokrati as a platform. The goal is to establish and accelerate media-specific, competition-neutral technological development with a focus on AI and data-driven journalism, and business, product and production development.\n- However we look at it, AI is probably the development that will affect us the most in the coming years. Maybe not until next year or the year after, but it's essential to keep in step with development in order to learn more and share experiences with others, says Adde Granberg, CTO at Sveriges Television.\nThe ambition is long-sighted, but the initiative is initially planned to extend until June 2021. The media companies will lead preliminary studies and projects together and will also have the opportunity to participate in other cross-sector initiatives. The initiative is financed by Vinnova and the participating media companies.\n- I think that AI will become an integral part of the media industry. We need to use technology to be able to foresee how readers receive our content so that we can utilise resources in the right way. And as we're focusing so much on our continued digital development, it seems like a natural step to participate in an environment which offers so much expertise within AI. We still have a lot to learn, says George Grönwald, Head of Data and Analysis at Hall Media.\nChristofer Ahlqvist, Editor-in-Chief at Göteborgs-Posten, the largest newspaper within Stampen Media, thinks along the same lines.\n- This is exciting – and an area in which we need to gain knowledge and that should be treated with respect. For those of us who work with news media, it's a matter of combining new technology like this with the craftsmanship that good journalism and editorship entail. If done in the right way, AI could be a way of ensuring that readers don't risk missing out on the journalism that interests them.\nThanks to this initiative, the participating media companies also gain access to the rest of AI Innovation of Sweden, which is now establishing development environments in several other locations in Sweden following its successful start in Gothenburg almost a year ago.\n- Our assessment is that this initiative will, in time, have great importance for the media industry's innovation capacity. Our goal is to get more companies involved by the end of the test period, says Holmberg.\nFacts: Period: December 2019 - June 2021Participants: Medier & Demokrati, Hall Media, Stampen Media, Sveriges Television and AI Innovation of Sweden.

By using the infrastructure that the Data Factory offers, it has been possible to dramatically increase efficiency in the research work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin SCAPIS, data from about 30,000 people has been collected at six university hospitals in Sweden, wherein each study participant was mapped with different samples and examinations and also had to answer a variety of questions in surveys. The analyses initiated by the material should provide answers to why diseases such as stroke, COPD, sudden cardiac arrest and myocardinal infarction occur, why some recover from them and others do not, and how to prevent them from occurring.\nThe SCAPIS study is unique in that it includes data from a series of physiological examinations, x-ray images, blood samples and responses from questionnaires from a comprehensive number of individuals. The large amount of data, a significant amount of which includes images, requires automatic methods for analysis that can hopefully be both faster and more consistent than manual evaluators.\nBy using a technical infrastructure like that of AI Innovation of Sweden's data factory, the training of deep learning algorithms can be made drastically more efficient as an important component in automatic analysis.\n\nDeep learning of algorithms will make diagnostics more efficient\nJennifer Alvén, doctoral candidate at Chalmers within the field of medical image analysis, is working on a project in which she develops automatic algorithms for analysis of SCAPIS images. In this particular case, it involves using deep learning in order to automatically outline coronary arteries in CTA (computed tomography angiography). Part of the training of the deep learning algorithms has now been carried out on the GPU cluster in AI Innovation of Sweden's data factory.\n\"I hope that we will be able to present a method that is at least as good as a manual evaluator at outlining coronary arteries and detecting and classifying stenosis (narrowing of the coronary arteries) and plaques,\" Jennifer explains.\nWith access to the data factory, it has gone significantly faster training my deep learning algorithms - from about 24 hours to 1 hour per training. It also frees up my regular computer so that I can use it for other purposes.\n\n\"Practically speaking, it is not possible to manually analyse the large amount of data. For example, it would take up to a couple of hours for an radiologist/radiographer to outline coronary arteries for an individual (i.e. one image).\"\n\nHandling of medical data places demands on the Data Factory\nJennifer's research project within SCAPIS is the largest that has been implemented in the Data Factory's infrastructure. The work has been in progress this autumn.\nJohanna Bergman, project manager at AI Innovation of Sweden, is very happy that SCAPIS chose to carry out their part of their work here.\n\n\"The work Jennifer is doing is important for medical research and for SCAPIS, and it is also a concrete example of how machine learning has potential within medical image analysis.\nTo now have the opportunity to test the infrastructure at The Data Factory has meant a major step forward for us. Because the SCAPIS project involves handling medical and personal data, there are very big demands on the project, not only in terms of speed, but also with respect to security and the legal aspects.\nSo, for our part, it has been an affirmation that we meet the requirements posed by medical image analysis and medical research.\"\nRead more about the project (in Swedish)\nAbout SCAPIS\nSCAPIS is a Swedish population study that will recruit and study the heart and lung status of 30,000 randomly selected women and men of the ages 50-64. The purpose is to be able to identify individual risks for stroke, COPD, sudden cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction and other heart diseases. The objective is to achieve much more in-depth knowledge about the emergence of the diseases in order to prevent them before they appear.

Earlier this year, Unionen published Victor's report \"Machines as bosses - About cognitive data systems, algorithm-based labour management and the Swedish labour market.”\n\nAt a morning seminar hosted by Unionen and AI Innovation of Sweden on 30 September, Victor presented further material from his study, showing how the labour market will be affected by new technologies, with a particular focus on the role of managers.\n\"Relatively soon, we will probably see an increase in algorithm-based management in various areas of the labour market; white collar and blue collar\", tells Victor.\n\"One example might be the use of data systems to fully or partially automate HR functions like recruitment. We may also see decision-making tools for bosses, such as full or partial automisation of required labour assessments.\"\n \"A desire for management that is driven more by data means increased data requirements. These bigger opportunities bring bigger challenges, not least with regard to ethics.\"\n \n\n\"The single most significant change that I foresee is that more and more companies and organisations will want to strengthen their capacity for working in a way that is driven by data. By this, I mean that they will increasingly analyse large amounts of data in order to produces a more precise basis for making decisions. This might be data about production volume or customer consumption trends, or lots of other things. A desire for management that is driven more by data means increased data requirements. These bigger opportunities bring bigger challenges, not least with regard to ethics.\"\n\nIs AI able to replace the role of the manager?\n\"I still think that most managerial tasks will end up being performed by people. Ultimately, I do not think that machines will be able to replace people in management. Machines may be able to perform deep analysis, but it will be people who will need to interpret that analysis and show the way forward.\"\nAlgorithm-based management has a lot of potential in terms of quality and efficiency. Victor points out, however, that there are various aspects that we perhaps need to be aware of.\"\n\"One concern with algorithm-based management is that people will rely too heavily on the conclusions and recommendations of cognitive computer systems without a critical analysis, such as an assessment of bias in the data that is used, or not having the full picture.\"\n\n\"It is, for example, hard to imagine that a computer system will have access to all the data that it would need to do a thorough analysis of a person's potential, abilities or work performance. We need to be aware of the limitations.\"\n\nManagers are not just decision-makers, but leaders too\nThe role of the manager is not just about decisions and data, but entails a relationship with the employee. This area is one of those that Victor thinks will be most difficult to replace.\n\"Complex human interactions are, I would say, something that machines are not going to be able to learn in the forseeable future, and in particular the relationship between manager and employee.\nAt present, we see examples where unsuccessful attempts have been made to automate managerial tasks. Often this is because the automation has eliminated the ability to interact with a manager, which forces the individual to integrate with \"the system\". There is a risk that people will not receive the right leadership, support and feedback. I'm not saying that such solutions couldn't work, but personally I  have yet to see one that I am satisfied with.\"\nRead the full report here"}

The idea is that AI Impact Lab should work as an entry point to AI competence within the educational sphere and to make it possible for industry and the public sector to benefit from AI research in their activities. And it is specifically the combination of many strong parties that makes the Örebro region so suitable as an AI hub,' says Örebro University Vice-Chancellor Johan Schnürer.\nAI Impact Lab will now start the work with establishing the new node, and introduce AI Innovation of Sweden to it's present partners. \n'We will go to all of our industrial partners and secure their commitment to establishing the hub and, not lastly, accelerated application of AI,' says Amy Loutfi, Pro-vice-chancellor for artificial intelligence at Örebro University.\n'When becoming a partner in AI Innovation of Sweden, you gain access and contribute to a network, resources, knowledge and data in order to speed up your AI development and it is very advantageous for both the private and public sector that a hub is now being established in Örebro. It is a matter of being able to work together with projects, resources, knowledge and other initiatives that drive the application of AI', Amy continues. \nThe node in Örebro will, among other things, work with health issues, something both AI Innovation of Sweden and Region Örebro County see as an important condition.\nThere is a critical mass of AI competence in Örebro\n'The fact that Örebro region is becoming a hub in the work with AI development is a recognition of the efforts we have made and the efforts we plan to make. It will help us improve our strength in the work on regional development, competitive strength and innovative capability,' says Irén Lejegren (S),  Regional Council and Chair in Region Örebro County's head of regional growth.\n'The university has established  internationally recognised AI research over a long time. We also have a region that has seen which unique strategic conditions Örebro has to offer. Without the dynamic between the university and region, it would have been difficult, but thanks to our collaboration with each other and with partners like Alfred Nobel Science Park and Inkubera, we have assembled a critical mass of AI competence. The AI hub also fits in outstandingly well as part of the university's new innovation arena,' Johan Schnürer continues.\n'We are very impressed by the dedicated and long-term efforts by Örebro University and Region Örebro Country for research, education and innovation, and I really look forward to the work together with AI Impact Lab, the region and the university to develop both the regional and national efforts within AI Innovation of Sweden for the best of region and Sweden's best,' says Martin Svensson, Co-Director at AI Innovation of Sweden.\nAbout AI Impact Lab\nÖrebro University and Region Örebro County are strengthening the region's development within artificial intelligence with the help of the AI Impact Lab. The idea is that it will function as a meeting place at the university where companies and the public sector can obtain new knowledge about the latest development within AI. Read more here"}

A steering group will now be set up, to reflect a greater part of the intended geography.\nNorthern Sweden Luleå Science Park leads the progress towards a Northern AI node\n\"Developments are progressing quickly in this area.

This year, they were filmed during their spring months and the extensive material holds plenty of interesting insights. But how do you structure 2000 hours of filmed material? To identify and analyze behaviors, events, and abnormalities is a time-consuming task for researchers. Enter AI and citizen science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, a two-day hackathon will be held in Gothenburg, with the aim of accelerating the research of guillemots and about the sensitive ecosystems of the Baltic Sea. Data scientists, programmers, and UX designers will team up with WWF, the Swedish University of Agriculture (SLU), Stockholm Resilience Center, the Baltic Seabird Project, and AI Innovation of Sweden, to work out ways to structure data on the seabirds.\nBaltic Seabird AI/UX Hackathon- information and registration\nCitizen Science and slow TV\nLast year, WWF and SLU invited the public to watch and comment on events in a live broadcast from one of the ledges on Stora Karlsö. Comments paired with time codes have enabled researchers to make great leaps forward in analyzing the material, they simply know what to look closely at, and when it occurred. The broadcast on WWF's website was a success, resulting in 1300+ comments and many new insights. The interest in three months of live broadcasting from a barren rock shelf can be compared to Swedish Television (SVT) somewhat unexpected viewing success in “slow TV” this spring, Den stora älgvandringen – three months of the quiet, live broadcast of forests waiting for the yearly moose migration.\n\"The public's great interest and efforts in previous projects have spurred us to continue to drive the development of the citizen research initiative and to allocate additional resources for, for example, hackathon and platform development,\" says marine expert Metta Wiese, WWF.\nThe guillemots as ‘litmus test’ of a sensitive ecosystem\nEcosystems are important for marine balance, but many of them are unfortunately out of balance. By studying seabirds around the clock, scientists have gained new insights into their life patterns, an important key in working to recreate resilient seas. \n\"We know that the herring these birds catch around the colony to feed the chicks are vital to them. Finding out more about how long they need to be away to find a fish and if some individuals are better than others at finding them, is interesting from a purely biological point of view, but also important information when it comes to studying how the seabirds on an individual level respond to ecosystem changes. One typical change is the amount of fish in the Baltic Sea,\" says marine researcher Jonas Hentai-Sundberg at SLU.\nWhat artificial intelligence can do\nFor Metta Wiese and Jonas Hentai-Sundberg, the hackathon will be a unique opportunity to collaborate cross-sectorally to save the seas. Using AI, researchers hope that the mapping of individuals and common events can be automated, emancipating resources of researchers and citizen science to observations and interpretations of the unusual and rare. \n\"Being able to identify individuals and events such as mating, brawl, feeding, arrivals and departures, gives the researchers the necessary tools to an in-depth understanding of the lives of the guillemots. Watching thousands of hours of film is impossible – but with automation, we hope to get a broader picture of everything happening on the ledge. If we then have knowledge of how the birds are moving, perhaps machine learning can be used to identify what they are doing and maybe who is doing it?\" says Jonas Hentai-Sundberg at SLU.\nAI Innovation of Sweden, WWF, and SLU are partnering with many more organizations for the hackathon. \n\nBaltic Seabird AI/UX hackathon, November 21-22\nOrganization\nWWF, SLU, Stockholm Resilience Centre, Baltic Seabird project, Chalmers AI Research Centre, AI Innovation of Sweden\nWith support from\nOcean Data Factory Sweden, SMHI, Space Data Lab, CGIT, Annotell, Zenuity"}

It is indispensable for weather forecasts and monitoring the climate, among other things, but it is also extremely important for forestry, agriculture and other fields in which up-to-date information about vegetation and the land surface is needed.\nProviding space data entails more than launching satellites. It takes major investments in ground stations with antennas and in servers, storage and networks that manage data from the satellites. The EU Copernicus programme alone generates 20 PB of data per year. The large quantities of data mean that merely providing data for download is not enough. An infrastructure for data exploitation with high performance near the data storage must also be available.\nWith the space data lab, the aim is to create a national infrastructure for exploitation of space data in order to increase the possibilities of developing smart and effective AI solutions for everything from storage of space data to how you can manage constellations of satellites in orbit.\nThe users of the data lab will be primarily public authorities with responsibility for civil, environmental and natural resources, but will also be able to include everything from large forestry companies to individual farmers and private persons.\n'With a national resource for analysis and calculations, more organisations will be able to utilise the benefits of the space data and limitations for use will be lowered, which will increase competitiveness, more efficient management and better decisions,' explains Tobias Edman, Head of Innovation and Public Benefit at the Swedish National Space Agency.\n\nSpace data and AI together create new opportunities'A use has been developed within forestry for monitoring of felling and clearing requirements, within conservation for vegetation classification and within agriculture for management of how much fertiliser should be used and where. There is a great need to be able to monitor fires, floods and drought within climate adaptation and crisis management,' continues Tobias Edman.\n'By linking with AI, the space data lab enables development of current services so that they become better and more efficient and also enable new applications.'\nAI Innovation of Sweden has the role as coordinator within the project and is responsible for sharing results, organising workshops with needs owners and finding new user groups for the data lab.\nThe National Space Data Lab project is partially financed by Vinnova and coordinated by AI Innovation of Sweden in cooperation with the Swedish National Space Agency, Rise and Luleå University of Technology"}

Over the decades since automation has infiltrated the automobile. Today we are closer than ever to realizing aspirations of a century ago, but challenges remain. This talk will center on elements of what is known about automation in the vehicle today and our evolution towards self-driving. Through the talk, results from an ongoing naturalistic study of ADAS and ADS being undertaken as part of the Advanced Vehicle Technology (AVT) consortium at MIT will be highlighted.\nLearning for Human-Centered Autonomy and Beyond\nBy Lex Fridman, Research Scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\nIn this talk you will be presented to a human-centered paradigm for building deep learning based driver-assistance, semi-autonomous, and fully-autonomous vehicle systems, contrasting it with how the problem is currently formulated and approached in academia and industry. The talk will include our work in driver state sensing, transfer of control, pedestrian interaction, driver functional vigilance in real-world AI-assisted driving with Tesla Autopilot, as well as discussion of the role of driver self-regulation, experiential learning, system imperfection, and driver monitor in successful deployment of AI-assisted driving.\nInformation driven healthcare – prerequisites, challenges and applied AI\nBy Dr. Philip D. Anderson, MD, Harvard Medical School and the Director of International Collaborations for the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in Boston and Markus Lingman, Chief strategy officer at Halland Hospital group, Region Halland\n\n\nIf data is the new oil, the healthcare industry tends to leave the oil in the ground – data is scattered in indecipherable formats across myriad different databases with different formatting, administrative ownership and privacy concerns, limiting our ability to achieve the kinds of transformational improvements in effectiveness and efficiency that have been achieved in other industries.  \n\nA multi-year collaboration between Region Halland in Sweden and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston has produced novel approaches to value-based, population oriented analytics and machine learning-based AI predictive modeling that are informing new more effective strategies for managing healthcare systems and delivering personalized precision medicine, on both sides of the Atlantic. \nIn this talk, we will get knowledge of the challenges, the results to date and future opportunities with information driven care."}

AI Innovation of Sweden is now starting a project together with our partners; Swedish Language Data Lab (Svenskt Språkdatalabb), to create a comprehensive set of NLP data for the Swedish language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA massive vocabulary is needed to interpret the human language\nNLP - Natural Language Processing - provides the ability for interpretation and analysis of the human language, with its underlying meaning and experience-based conclusions that we humans have naturally when we read or listen to a text.\nBy means of mathematics and algorithms, computers can process language automatically, but in addition to the pure understanding, other analyses such as sentiment analysis is also required to understand a text. Sentiment analysis means attempting to understand the feeling or the opinions contained within a text and can involve understanding if the text indicates someone's opinion or mood. In order to train the computers in this respect and thereby creating a linguistically-intelligent AI motor, a basic requirement is access to comprehensively annotated quantities of data, which means that there is a large amount of data which can be used to train the models.\nSwedish Language Data Lab will be a national NLP resource\nAI Innovation of Sweden will now start up the work to create an infrastructure for Swedish data sets in which annotated, classified data and fully trained models are made available. The objective of the Swedish Language Data Lab is to create a national knowledge node within language technology and to develop Swedish reference data sets for NLP which will be made accessible with open access in AI Innovation of Sweden's data factory.\nIn addition to ordinary glossaries and including existing Swedish data sets, the raw data will be collected from a large number of sources, including news text, social media, internet forums and reviews from various fields. The project will, in addition to annotated data, produce a number of fully trained models for entity tagging and sentiment analysis, among other things, in order to enable additional research and innovation.\n\nThe Swedish Language Database project is partially financed by Vinnova and will be operated by AI Innovation of Sweden in collaboration with partners with expertise within NLP, including Recorded Future, Gavagai, Talkamatic, Språkbanken and SKL together with a reference group consisting of a wide range of needs owners from various fields.\n \nVanja Carlén, Project Manager at AI Innovation of Sweden will lead the project.\n\nWhy do AI Innovation of Sweden want to be a part of this project?\"The new technology places high demands on models that understand and can generate natural language and we are increasingly encountering NLP without being aware of it. Access to models and open data for the Swedish language will facilitate development of Swedish language applications for industry, academics and within the public sector - we don't want to fall behind!\"\nWho do you think will be the major users of Swedish Language Data Lab?\"There has been a great deal of interest in the project and we see needs owners ranging from academics to industry and the public sector. Many applications require large sets of Swedish training data and we are now seeing a great deal of interest in pre-trained models and, for example, translation applications. We also see a great deal of interest in further development of the data sets for applications within specific domains, such as law and medicine.\"\nWhat do you see as the greatest difficulty associated with the linguistic part of AI? What are and what will be the greatest challenges?\"Swedish is a small language and global players do not ordinarily have any interest in developing annotated data sets for Swedish. The development of models adapted for the Swedish language is becoming all the more important and the amount of open Swedish data is limited. Large sets of data for development of NLP models are needed and a limiting factor is that the texts may be protected by copyright or contain personal data and cannot be shared as a result. In this project, we will also develop background-trained models that will handle this - we will provide models trained on sensitive data without sharing the basic data. The provision of Swedish text and models will contribute to maintaining the linguistic diversity and promote innovation within the NLP field in Sweden, which is something that will benefit a multitude of interested parties.\"\nYou have been a project manager at AI Innovation of Sweden for a while now. What other projects do you work on?\"In addition to involvement in the Swedish Language Database, I will be project manager in the National Swedish Space Data Lab (Nationella Rymddata-labbet) together with the Swedish National Space Agency, RISE and Luleå University.\""}

In order to create applications and solutions from research and innovation, a basic understanding of opportunities and possible dangers are needed. AI Innovation, Vinnova and Linköping University now provides Sweden with opportunities for such understanding. Elements of AI is free, open for all and comes in both English, Finnish and, as of May 15, Swedish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge about AI should be for all \nAI, or artificial intelligence, is already part of our everyday life. Despite that, very few know what AI actually is and how it works. For Teemu Roos, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Helsinki, knowledge is a democratic matter.\n– We use AI every day. In almost anything we do, the technology is involved in one way or another. In social media, communications, if you read the news or watch videos on the internet. If people don’t understand how algorithms in social media works, to give an example, then they will not know what they should be critical of. Talk about filter bubbles and attempts to influence national elections will not mean anything. We need to discuss what type of AI is good and which type must be limited. To ensure a democratic discourse, the public needs to know what it is all about.\nSeveral significant investments are being made to increase knowledge about AI in Sweden. The Swedish government recently announced another 20 million SEK for higher education and life long learning within the field of AI.Read more\nThe educational platform of Elements of AI has been very successful in Finland, launched in 2018 as a collaboration between the University of Helsinki and the IT company Reaktor. The platform is intended to give the entire population, not just experts, a basic knowledge of what AI is.\nVinnova, AI Innovation of Sweden and Linköping University now makes the Elements of AI available in Swedish for everyone. The aim is to reach 1% of the Swedish population, that’s roughly 100,000 people.\n”Folkbildning” – a Nordic paradigm\nAI researcher at Linköping University, and part of the EU Commission's expert group for AI, Fredrik Heinz, emphasizes that humans must be at the center of AI development.\n– \"Folkbildning\", free and massive education, is a Nordic paradigm. I hope as many people as possible seize the opportunity to learn more about AI. There is also the possibility of obtaining higher education credits (ECTS) for the course Elements of AI by applying for the online course through www.antagning.se - Grunderna i AI, given through Linköping University.\nIn less than a year, Finland managed to educate one percent of the population, more than fifty-five thousand, and twice as many outside the country's borders, Teemu Roos at the University of Helsinki says:\n– The course is not about how to make money using AI or how to build your own AI platform. What we provide is general basic knowledge, an awareness of what the technology is and how it is and can be used.\nReaching one percent of the population is also the goal of the Swedish initiative.– Sweden is good at digitization, now it is crucial to take the next step, says Fredrik Heinz.\nHe continues:\n– AI is something that affects all people, and therefore it is especially important to offer a general education in AI, what it is and how it affects us. It makes it easier for us to understand the consequences of technology and how we can use it in the best way.\nSwedish launch event\nOn May 15 the organizations behind Elements of AI hosted a launch lecture at Stockholm School of Economics. Fredrik Heintz, AI researcher at Linköping University, spoke on what AI really means and how it affects us now and in the future. Annie Lindmark, Innovation Management, and Karin Sevedag Tell, Director of Communications at Vinnova, spoke together on how and why Vinnova will take on the challange to educate a bold number of their staff this year. Jan Smith, Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers, spoke on AI Competence for Sweden – a National Initiative on Education and Competence Development in Artificial Intelligence.\nElements of AI\nThe course Elements of AI launched in Swedish on May 15. At www.elementsofai.se already more than two-thousand Swedes have taken the course in English. The same course is given, with the possibility of ECTS, by applying to the course \"Grunderna i AI\" via antagning.se. The University course is open for late registration even after the standard deadline of April 15."}

The data factory will make data and infrastructure available in a unique way, which will accelerate research and innovation in the AI sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Lindberg’s background makes him absolutely perfect to build the data factory at AI Innovation of Sweden. Most recently, he comes from the Andra AP fund, where he worked in quantitative management and is an associate professor with a PHD in mathematical statistics at Chalmer’s. Carl is also one of the founders of high-profile Gothenburg company Sigmastocks, which is an Artificial Intelligence-based tool for stock investment.\nSince just a few weeks ago, he has been splitting his time between Zenuity, where he is responsible for strategic data applications and AI Innovation of Sweden.\n“The fact that Zenuity is helping out by allowing us to share in Carl's experience and expertise is just one of the many examples of partnerships and collaborations that are enabling the development of AI in industry and welfare in Sweden.” says Martin Svensson, Co-director at AI Innovation of Sweden.\n“There are several amazing initiatives going on in the field of AI right now: business, academia and by the authorities; there is a tremendous amount of energy. It is particularly pleasing to be able to be a part of this, and to play a role in the exchange of all this energy and the various initiatives. A lot of people are keen to get things done; to evolve and to develop things. We can give them the best conditions that will help them to make progress.” Carl Lindberg says.\n“Doing AI properly requires a lot of data and a powerful computation capacity, which is exactly what we will be able to offer, in combination with a community that represents a variety of companies and organisations who are able to meet up and implement projects together, ” he continues.\nMats Nordlund is in charge of research at Zenuity:\n“Data plays a very important role in the development of AI. At Zenuity, we have loads of experience in building and running your own data factory. Carl compliments Zenuity’s skills and abilities in relation to data and we are pleased that he will also be able to engage with AI Innovation of Sweden and help us contribute towards the rapidly growing national AI ecosystem.”\nA resource that make things possible\nThe data factory will be one of the most important cornerstones in AI Innovation of Sweden’s mission, in which data is a prerequisite for AI development and training AIs. At the same time, access to comprehensive, good-quality data is in short supply, causing bottlenecks in many projects and initiatives.\nRight now, we are working intensively to get the infrastructure we require in place, and to make the first sets of data available. Both Carl Lindberg and Martin Svensson point out that progress to this point has been rapid, and that plenty more exciting things lie ahead over the next few weeks and months.\n“We are designing the data factory to be a resilient environment, which will enable the exchange of all the energy and the quantity good initiatives that are out there.” says Carl Lindberg. “People will be able to come here and work, if that’s what they want to do. In the long term, this can lead to unique solutions within companies and will allow the birth of new products and companies.  This work will benefit research, industry and welfare.”\n“This type of project is about entrepreneurship. We are building an exciting product that can help initiatives and collaborations to increase their reach and make improvements,” says Carl Lindberg, adding “We are building a resource that makes things possible.”\n \nAI Innovation of Sweden is funded by Vinnova, Region Västra Götaland, and partners from the industrial and public sectors, research institutions and the academic world. Interested parties from these fields are invited to become partners in order to help build up significant resources with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of Swedish industry and improving Sweden’s interests in the long term. The initiative is officially hosted by Lindholmen Science Park AB.\nZenuity is a leading developer of software for self-driving cars (Autonomous Driving, AD) and driver-assisting technology (ADAS, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). Our flexible approach helps us integrate closely with our clients within the automotive industry, resulting in quick delivery of new technologies.

It is a seminar intended for a general audience with interested in technology at the festival in the Nordstan district of Gothenburg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Innovation and the Swedish Tax Agency discussed the development of AI and how you already encounter or will encounter the new technology in your everyday life as a private person.\nThe Swedish Tax Agency is one of the public authorities that has begun to launch pilots to facilitate customer service and reception with the help of AI. Göran Sundin, digital strategist at the Swedish Tax Agency, presented the Swedish Tax Agency's digital employee, the chatbot 'Skatti', who helps answer people's questions about their tax returns. Skatti handles around 15,000 chats per months hand has answered approximately 200,000 queries thus far with individual treatment of the customers.\nViktoria Josefsson, AI strategist at the Swedish Tax Agency, explained more about how the Swedish Tax Agency foresees the role of AI in the future.\nWhat are your expectations for Skatti going forward?'We work consistently to train Skatti in new areas so that they can answer more questions. Eventually, we hope to train Skatti in several languages and to test speech as a complement to the text chat.  Some other interesting areas to investigate include chat while logged in and the possibility of escalating to human chat.\nWith Skatti, we can make our service more personal and more efficient. Skatti also works essentially round the clock, which makes us more accessible.'\nWhat does the Swedish Tax Agency's foresee for future possibilities for the use artificial intelligence?'We want to use AI partly to make it easier for our customers to get into touch with us, and we also want to use AI to actually make it difficult for people to avoid their fiscal duties and to fight crime. To put it simply, we want to secure tax money so that we can finance our general welfare. That is our mission.\nOne of AI's move important contributions is to create conditions to do more of what requires human intelligence. For us, it's about reinforcing human competence with AI. It's man and machine in cooperation.'\nThe ethical perspective is important'We are also testing various AI technologies with Skatti and text analysis, etc., so we also work actively with AI from an ethical perspective. The Swedish Tax Agency enjoys high credibility with the general public and we strive to maintain it. And citizens and enterprisers alike should feel safe that the Swedish Tax Agency handles information and artificial intelligence the right way.'\nCooperation is necessary for success'Our mission as a public authority requires that we cooperate with other authorities in order to handle the possibilities of digitalisation. And innovative development requires cooperation, so we have to have a presence in situations where we can meet other participants in the community, including the private sector and academia. That's why we have participated in two such initiatives: AI Innovation of Sweden and AI Sustainability Center, where we focus on the ethical aspects of AI.\nThe idea is that we can learn more about the technology, see and test new possibilities and learn lessons from what other have done. Of course, we will also share our experience and knowledge of the field. Hopefully, we will also be able to share our data to the extent that is possible.'"}

In her graduation thesis \"AI –The Lawyer&#39;s Tool or Replacement?\" she analysed and attempted to predict how AI will affect the legal field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is leaving its mark in many areas and one of the areas expected to be affected the most is law. Analysis and automatic generation of standardised contracts and other legal document with the assistance of AI tools is already a new field that is beginning to gain footing and is expected to develop rapidly. Of course, this is something that will affect the role of the legal profession and the organisation of the law office in the future.\nAn example of this is part of a study conducted by the legal AI platform Lawgeex in collaboration with Stanford, Duke and UCLA in which an artificial intelligence and a group of lawyers evaluated five different contracts. In these cases, Lawgeex answered correctly in 95 per cent of cases, a significant difference from the human participants with an average below 85 per cent. The AI also completed the task in 26 minutes, whereas the human lawyers took an average of 92 minutes.\nThis result clearly shows that some services can be replaced, but how long can the technology be expected to succeed in this field where human contact, trust and negotiation are important elements?\nYour thesis examines how the law offices and legal field must adapt to the new technology. Why is it important for law offices to keep in step with the new technical development?\"AI has a great potential to improve conditions for how we provide legal services in terms of improving efficiency of certain types of legal tasks, increasing certainty in certain results and reducing costs for clients. Law offices must participate in this development, partly because this work is extremely important, but also to be able to continue to meet the demands for generally accepted legal practice in the future. Getting on board early and developing and using AI tools can also be a major competitive advantage.\"\nWhich legal tasks can and should be automated? And what types of services can be changed first?\"It will mainly involve routine tasks that can be automated. We can already see how AI is affecting legal work by creating legal documents and making legal tools available online. AI can also study large amounts of data, which is advantageous for Due Diligence or before a legal action.\"\n\"However, some elements of legal work are more difficult to automate and it is important that the parts which are automated entail an improvement and do no merely improve efficiency. The lawyer´s tasks are complex, involving very human interaction and the capacity to quickly understand and adjust to sudden and unforeseeable changes. The attorney´s role is also to find alternatives to going to court, including mediation, negotiation and settlement between parties. The role is based on trust and confidence and the client´s wishes and requirements and the attorney must take a pedagogic approach to advising the client. This requires intuition and empathetic intelligence, which means that most of the attorney´s work today cannot be replaced by AI and a person is needed to ensure that consultation is provided in a legally certain manner.\"\nHow important is the law in the development of new services and what problem areas must be addressed?\"The law will play a central role in the continued development of artificial intelligence and the development of new services, not lastly in consideration of establishing good conditions for development and assure protection based on various aspects.\"\n\"I also think it is important to have accommodative legislation that is adapted to the new technological society so that the law does not become an obstacle to continued development and to avoid applying old solutions to new problems.\"\nRead the thesis here"}

Of course the interest comes with expectations and it is now time to start making things happen\", says Martin Svensson, Co-director of AI Innovation of Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Innovation of Sweden´s main focus is to accelerate implementation of AI through collaboration and cross-industry sharing. The ambition is to be a catalyst in the Swedish AI ecosystem and support applied AI research and innovation.\nIt is a big scope, what is the next step?\"We now need to get started on a number of fronts, not least establishing operational collaborations with and support the best exisiting initiatives, organisations and experts. The only way to manage the big scope is to identify, embrace and broaden the already great activities and build an extended team that can make significant difference for Sweden. We also want to activate the ecosystem and kick off the first projects. Many partners are ready to go, and we are building our own organisation and network to support the interest. Our focus, besides starting up projects, is to realise the Data Factory and establish the co-location community to provide the best possible working conditions to the team members on site.\" \nThere has been a lot of work to get the business in place, what have been and are the biggest challenges?​\"In May last year I don't think we fully understood what we got ourselves into. All questions related to AI are highly important for Swedish industry, public sector as well as acadmia and research institutes, and many people worked hard all autumn to define a structure that could be valuable and accepted broadly. We decided early on to hold as many bi-lateral meeting as we possible could, primarily to make sure we gained a solid understanding of the actual needs of industry and public sector.\"\n\"I would say that the greatest challenges (and also greatest opportunities) have been to meet the hundreds of companies and organisations across Sweden showing interest, and to conceptualise enough for people to understand and yet be allowed to influence\" \n\nUntil now, more than 40 companies and organisations have joined as partners in AI Innovation of Sweden. Are more partners coming in?\"Several companies and organisations have contacted us and want to join, and we expect to increase the number of partners during spring. But first we need to start generating value to the ones who are already with us. Their success is our success\"\nIf you have ideas about AI-projects, how do you proceed?​\"We have opened a call for project ideas and will focus on projects making existing data available, projects relevant to many and projects in one or the other way really accelerating AI related research and innovation. Partners submit their ideas through ai.se\"\nHow do you look at the future, where and what is AI Innovation of Sweden in 3 years?​\"The next three years will be important and most likely very challenging. Our mission is to serve as an engine in the ecosystem and facilitate that Sweden's total capabilites in AI are strong and coordinated. Together we need to excel in quite a few aspects, which will require that we find ways and courage to boost the best and distribute the responsibilites to the organisations best suited for each task. For Sweden to be successful we need to build a strong team AI of Sweden. AI Innovation of Sweden will be 100% dedicated to the needs of Swedish industry and society, and to  ambitiously drive collaboration across Sweden, across verticals and across industy, academia and research institutes and public sector.\"\nFounding partners of AI Innovation of Sweden\nRead more about AI Innovation of Sweden"}

The Minister for Energy and Digitalisation, Anders Ygeman, was there to open the national centre, which will use cooperation and co-location to accelerate innovation and research in practical applied Artificial Intelligence - AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main funding has come from Sweden’s innovation agency, Vinnova, and the agency’s director general, Darja Isaksson, expresses some of Vinnova’s thoughts about how this initiative will meet society’s needs. \n“Sweden needs to focus its efforts on research and innovation within AI in order to enhance its long-term competitiveness and its opportunities to develop solutions that meet important needs in society,” said Darja Isaksson. \n“AI Innovation of Sweden represents an important piece of the puzzle as it is a nationally cohesive structure with multiple geographical nodes. Now the first, western node is in place. Together with other nodes with different profiles, this initiative is helping to advance Sweden's position,” said Isaksson in conclusion.\n\nAI Innovation of Sweden is a national and neutral initiative which is intended to function as an engine in the Swedish AI ecosystem. The focus is on accelerating implementation of AI by means of sharing knowledge and data, co-location and collaboration projects, all with a strong focus on ethics, transparency and security. AI Innovation of Sweden establishes shared resources, for example the “Data Factory”, which will make data available in a new and unique way, and “Co-Location sites” with the aim of improving collaboration, knowledge-sharing and the ability to attract talent. Over 40 organisations and companies - from the industrial and academic worlds and the public sector - have signed up so far, and more are expected. \nThe Minister for Energy and Digitalisation, Anders Ygeman emphasised the significance of the centre.\n“Sweden should be the best in the world at using the opportunities presented by digitalisation. AI Innovation of Sweden is an important part of making this a reality,”said Anders Ygeman.\n\nLindholmen Science Park AB has the role of host for AI Innovation of Sweden, and it is clear that there is considerable interest in the initiative.\n“The will and the need to be a part of an ecosystem has been very evident from the hundreds of discussions we have had during the preparatory work for AI Innovation of Sweden. The tremendous commitment we have had from industry, the academic world and the public sector is now giving us the opportunity to establish a substantial and valuable resource for Sweden and for Swedish industry,”says Martin Svensson, Co-director, AI Innovation of Sweden, Lindholmen Science Park.\nThe opening ceremony also saw the launch in Sweden of the free on-line training course “Elements of AI”, with the aim of accelerating the level of knowledge within AI. The course has the backing of the University of Helsinki and Reaktor, a Finnish IT consultancy firm. So far over 1% of Finland’s population and a total of 130,000 students have started on the course. Vinnova is financing a translation into Swedish together with the launch in Sweden, and AI Innovation of Sweden is coordinating involvement by Swedish industry, the academic world and the public sector.\n“Because AI affects everyone, one of the most pressing issues is to increase understanding of and knowledge about AI. Elements of AI will allow us to significantly improve AI expertise in Sweden. I am looking forward to the challenge and to getting even more people in Sweden to take the course than in Finland!” says Fredrik Heintz, AI researcher at Linköping University, the academic partner in Elements of AI.\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, Anders Ygeman unlocked the doors to AI Innovation of Sweden’s new co-location premises. \n\nTake part of EFN´s report from the inaguration (in Swedish)\n\nAI Innovation of Sweden is funded by Vinnova, Region Västra Götaland, and partners from the industrial and public sectors, research institutions and the academic world. Interested parties from these fields are invited to become partners in order to help build up significant resources with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of Swedish industry and improving Sweden’s interests in the long term. The initiative is officially hosted by Lindholmen Science Park AB."}

But when it comes to artificial intelligence, we are far behind, something that is also articulated in the national strategy recently presented by the government, which aims to outline the future direction of this area. The strategy is based on an assessment carried out on Sweden’s AI capabilities by the innovation agency Vinnova. The assessment identified a number of problem areas, among them a shortfall of expertise in the field.\nThe United States currently is at the forefront of development into AI, with China following second. But it is not only Sweden that has a way to go – all of Europe has fallen behind in the field of AI.  \n“With this innovative approach to establishing a data factory and massive investment from of a number of companies and social contributors, I believe it is possible for us to have a world-class AI centre with an international reputation that will help Europe move up on the international stage,” says Peter Eriksson, Minister for housing and digital development.   \nRead more on businessregiongoteborg.se"}

It is available as an open model for businesses and organizations to use in their products and services. The model provides Sweden with a crucial resource that strengthens our ability to use AI for increased competitiveness and a stronger welfare system. Developed by AI Sweden in collaboration with WASP and RISE, GPT-SW3 is specifically developed for Swedish and Nordic languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch of GPT-SW3 interpreted by OpenAI's DALL-E 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-SW3 can be used for a variety of tasks such as building solutions for text analysis, classification, text generation, text processing, content moderation, and chat functionalities.\nAs a result, it addresses some of the challenges faced by both the private sector and the public sector concerning other available large-scale language models. Some of these obstacles include ambiguities surrounding training data, unclear licensing terms, or that models are only accessible as cloud services.\nThere is a significant need for a model trained on Swedish text with clear licensing terms that can be fine-tuned to meet specific requirements and run on dedicated hardware, both for legal reasons and business competitiveness.

These initiatives will also strengthen Sweden’s capabilities in AI and digital sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Sweden has recently made the first major language model for Nordic languages, GPT-SW3, freely available as an open resource. Now, two new important steps are being taken to advance both Swedish development and Swedish usage of large language models.\nThe first initiative focuses on developing the first major multimodal language model in and for Sweden. This follows international trends in AI. The model will have a broad ability to solve a variety of tasks, including interaction with external tools such as databases and web browsers. It will also be able to process and generate images and audio. Like GPT-SW3, this new model will serve as a new national resource for Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we started working on GPT-SW3, the frontline has shifted from pure language models to those that also handle sound and image. For Sweden’s digital sovereignty, it is crucial to have our own expertise and technology because it gives us control over training data and governance over the technology. By starting to train these models now, we ensure we are at the forefront of technological development\n\n\n\nMagnus Sahlgren, Head of NLU på AI Sweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn parallel, AI Sweden is collaborating with partners to create a shared digital assistant for the public sector. This assistant will be developed by fine-tuning a large language model—like GPT-SW3—with data generated by employees in public organizations. Similar to ChatGPT but tailored for Swedish public service needs and developed with our democratic values, norms, and societal diversity in mind; all while securely managing input data. The use and evolution of this assistant represent a novel approach within the public sector that will foster continuous improvement and adaptation through each employee's contributions directly shaping a more intelligent and efficient digital assistant.\nBy supporting employees in their text-based tasks, this assistant aims to simplify everyday work for public servants allowing them time for more interpersonal value-added tasks. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all employees regardless of their tech skills, capable of tasks such as:\nSummarizing large bodies of text.\nEnhancing text clarity.\nGenerating documents like reports or applications according to specific templates.\nClassifying documents for decision-making processes.\nProviding personalized support for citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweden faces significant challenges within welfare services. The public sector needs modern tools where AI can maximize impact quality-wise. Many organizations are too small to build such resources alone while larger ones depend on smaller entities for sufficient data volumes required for truly capable AI products. This digital assistant is a unique solution that strengthens Sweden’s ability to harness AI power through national collaboration.\n\n\nJonatan Permert, AI-transformationsstrateg, AI Sweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese initiatives strengthens Sweden's position in terms of digital sovereignty and AI capabilities by developing expertise around large language models while making advanced AI resources widely accessible. They should be viewed as modern infrastructure where central entities coordinate development resources or services beyond individual actors' capacity or means alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s always inspiring to hear about exciting AI initiatives from different actors. When used correctly, AI can lead to increased innovation, strengthened competitiveness, better welfare, and a more efficient public administration\n\n\nMinister of Public Administration, Erik Slottner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Future's Digital Assistant for the Public Sector\nThe project's goal is to develop an AI-powered digital assistant designed to support public sector employees with a variety of text-related tasks.\nThis assistant will be built on a Swedish language model and trained using instructional data provided by the employees themselves.\nThe development is structured in multiple phases:\nThe first phase, which is currently being financed by Vinnova and its partners, will run until the summer of 2024. Participants from the public sector include Kungsbacka Municipality, Tjörn Municipality, Gothenburg City, Region Skåne, Region Halland, and Västra Götaland Region. Intel is partnering as the hardware provider for the necessary technology.\nIn phase two, expected to extend until the end of 2025/2026, we anticipate a significant increase in participating municipalities and regions.\nBy 2026, the ambition is for the digital assistant to be fully operational for long-term deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal Language Model\nAI Sweden is progressing from its initial large-scale Nordic language model GPT-SW3 towards creating a comprehensive multimodal model capable of processing not just text but also images and audio.\nThe goal is to create a family of models with the largest one boasting at least 100 billion parameters.\nAll models developed within this project are intended to be open-source; meaning they can be downloaded freely and are available for modification, fine-tuning, research, and commercialization.\nThe development roadmap consists of multiple phases:\nThe first phase (financed by Vinnova) will continue until summer 2024 and includes data collection for training purposes.\nPhase two is targeted for completion by the end of 2024.

Dessa stärker samtidigt Sveriges AI-förmåga och digitala suveränitet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Sweden gjorde nyligen den första stora språkmodellen för nordiska språk, GPT-SW3, fritt tillgänglig som en öppen resurs. Nu tas två nya centrala steg inom både svensk utveckling och svensk användning av stora språkmodeller. Den ena satsningen handlar om att utveckla den första stora multimodala språkmodellen i och för Sverige. Detta följer den internationella utvecklingen på området. Modellen kommer ha en generell förmåga att lösa en stor mängd olika uppgifter, inklusive att interagera med externa verktyg som databaser och webbläsare. Den kommer även kunna hantera och generera bilder och ljud. Denna nya modell kommer sedan, likt GPT-SW3, att utgöra en ny nationell resurs för Sverige.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSedan vi började arbetet med GPT-SW3 har frontlinjen flyttats, från renodlade språkmodeller till modeller som även hanterar ljud och bild. För Sveriges digitala suveränitet är det avgörande med egen kompetens och egen teknik, eftersom det ger oss inflytande över träningsdata och skapar rådighet över tekniken. Genom att starta bygget av de här modellerna nu är vi med i täten av den tekniska utvecklingen.\n\n\n\nMagnus Sahlgren, Head of NLU på AI Sweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParallellt görs en satsning av AI Sweden tillsammans med partners för att bygga en gemensam digital assistent för offentlig sektor. Assistenten kommer att utvecklas genom att finjustera en stor språkmodell, exempelvis GPT-SW3, med hjälp av data genererade av medarbetare i offentliga organisationer. Inte olik ChatGPT, men skräddarsydd för svensk offentlig sektor och utvecklad med våra demokratiska värden, normer och samhälleliga mångfald och där data som matas in hanteras säkert. Assistentens användning och utveckling representerar ett nytt arbetssätt för offentlig sektor. Den kommer att skapa en självförstärkande spiral av kontinuerlig förbättring och anpassning, där varje medarbetares bidrag direkt medverkar till att forma en mer intelligent och effektiv digital assistent.\n \nGenom att stödja medarbetare i deras textbaserade arbetsuppgifter kommer assistenten att förenkla offentliganställdas vardag och frigöra tid för mer mellanmänskliga och värdefulla uppgifter. Den ska vara lättanvänd och tillgänglig för alla medarbetare, oavsett deras tekniska kompetens, och ska bland annat kunna utföra uppgifter som att:\nSammanfatta och analysera stora textmassor.\nFörbättra och redigera texter för att göra dem mer lättlästa och strukturerade.\nSkapa nya texter som rapporter, handlingar och ansökningar, anpassade efter specifika mallar och riktlinjer.\nKlassificera dokument och skapa beslutsunderlag i handläggningsprocesser.\nTa fram individualiserat stöd åt medborgare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSverige står inför en stor välfärdsutmaning. Offentlig sektor behöver moderna verktyg och smarta arbetssätt där de med hjälp av AI kan få så stor effekt som möjligt med ökad kvalitet. Många organisationer är för små för att kunna bygga en sån här resurs på egen hand och de stora är beroende av de små för att uppnå de datamängder som krävs för att utveckla verkligt kapabla AI-produkter. Den gemensamma digitala assistenten för offentlig sektor är en unik lösning som genom nationell samverkan stärker Sveriges förmåga att nyttja kraften i AI.\n\n\nJonatan Permert, AI-transformationsstrateg, AI Sweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenom dessa två satsningar stärker Sverige sin digitala suveränitet och sin AI-förmåga. Genom att både utveckla kompetensen kring stora språkmodeller och genom att göra avancerade AI-resurser brett tillgängliga ökar Sveriges nationella handlingsutrymme. Satsningarna bör ses som modern infrastruktur, där en central aktör samordnar utvecklingen av resurser eller tjänster som varje enskild aktör inte har förmåga eller resurser att göra på egen hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDet är alltid glädjande att höra om spännande AI-initiativ från olika aktörer. Rätt använt kan AI bidra till ökad innovationsförmåga, stärkt konkurrenskraft, bättre välfärd och effektivare offentlig förvaltning. Det här är utmärkta exempel på konkreta förslag som leder till bättre förutsättningar för konkurrenskraftig, säker och etisk AI-utveckling i Sverige, både inom den offentliga förvaltningen och inom näringslivet.\n\n\nCivilminister Erik Slottner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramtidens digitala assistent för offentlig sektor\nProjektets mål är att utveckla en digital assistent baserad på AI-teknik. Den ska vara ett stöd till medarbetare inom offentlig sektor i en stor variation av textrelaterade arbetsuppgifter.\nAssistenten kommer att baseras på en svensk språkmodell och tränas med hjälp instruktionsdata genererade av medarbetarna.\nUtvecklingen av assistenten planeras i flera faser:\nDet är den första fasen som nu finansieras av Vinnova och partners. Den pågår fram till sommaren 2024. Från offentlig sektor deltar Kungsbacka kommun, Tjörns kommun, Göteborgs stad, Region Skåne, Region Halland och Västra Götalandsregionen. Intel är projektets hårdvarupartner och kommer att bistå projektet med all hårdvara som krävs.\nI fas 2 som planeras pågå till årsskiftet 2025/2026, förväntas antalet kommuner och regioner öka avsevärt.\nFrån 2026 är ambitionen att assistenten ska vara klar att förvaltas för långsiktig drift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal språkmodell\nAI Sweden tar nästa kliv efter den första nordiska storskaliga språkmodellen GPT-SW3. Målet är en storskalig, multimodal modell som vid sidan av text också kan hantera bild och ljud.\nAmbitionen är en modellfamilj där den största har minst 100 miljarder parametrar. \nAlla modeller som utvecklas inom detta projekt planeras vara öppna och därmed nedladdningsbara och tillgängliga för modifiering, finjustering, forskning och kommersialisering.\nUtvecklingen av modellen planeras till olika faser:\nDet är den första fasen, som pågår fram till sommaren 2024, som nu finansieras av Vinnova. Under perioden samlas bland annat data för träning av modellen in.\nEtapp två planeras fram till slutet av 2024. Under perioden planeras den storskaliga träningen av den nya modellen ske.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFör mer information, kontakta\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Magnus Sahlgren\n\n\nHead of Research, NLU\nmagnus.sahlgren@ai.se\n+46 (0)76-315 34 80\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Jonatan Permert\n\n\n AI Transformation Strategist\njonatan.permert@ai.se\n+46 (0)73-972 59 14"}

Success in this area requires two things: clear national leadership and national investments,\" says Martin Svensson, and continues:\n\"Countries in the AI forefront, like the USA, UK, Canada, and Singapore, have set up similar commissions. These commissions have been instrumental in understanding how AI can create value and the path to get there. National investments are often discussed, and they will be crucial for Sweden to rapidly adopt AI, use it to solve societal challenges, and enhance competitiveness. However, leadership at all levels is equally important. The AI Commission will be a vital tool for the government to develop its share of the leadership needed.\"\nSince its inception, AI Sweden's mission has been to accelerate the use of AI in Sweden, benefiting both competitiveness and welfare. The partner network now includes over 120 organizations, including municipalities, governmental agencies, and private sector entities ranging from Swedish startups to large international corporations, and academic institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy working with our partners, we have built a lot of knowledge on what value AI can create, how to do that, and what's needed to succeed.

Och för att lyckas med det krävs två saker: Ett tydligt nationellt ledarskap och nationella investeringar,” säger han.\n“I princip alla länder som ligger långt fram, USA, England, Kanada, Singapore, har haft en motsvarighet till den här kommissionen. Det har hjälpt till att bygga en förståelse för hur AI kan skapa värde, och hur vägen dit ser ut. Nationella investeringar pratas det mycket om, och investeringar kommer vara avgörande för hur snabbt Sveriges tar till sig AI och brett börjar använda AI för att lösa samhällsutmaningar och stärker vår konkurrenskraft. Men det vi sett är att det inte bara handlar om pengarna, ledarskap på alla nivåer är också oerhört viktigt. AI-kommissionen blir ett viktigt verktyg för regeringen att kunna utveckla sin del av det ledarskap som behövs.\"\nAI Swedens uppdrag har sedan starten varit att tillsammans med partnernätverket accelerera användningen av AI i Sverige, till nytta för både konkurrenskraft och välfärd. Idag består det nätverket av drygt 120 organisationer, där kommuner, myndigheter och andra aktörer från offentlig sektor samverkar med privat näringsliv i hela spannet från svenska startups till internationella jättar – och med akademin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVi har den vägen skapat en bra förståelse för vilket värde AI kan skapa, hur man realiserar det, och vad som behövs framöver.

Especially when you have data that can't leave the company. Robert Nyquist from Smartr will present a use case for optimizing resource planning at Länsförsäkringar. Using simple methods that create value quickly and can scale up within the organization.\nWe are excited to invite you to the first Partner Breakfast Seminar after summer, where we will delve into a critical and timely topic: \"Enhancing Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure.\" This seminar will provide a platform for partners within AI Sweden to come together, discuss, and identify new areas of collaboration in the realm of cybersecurity.\nThis seminar will focus on the role of cybersecurity education and training across governmental agencies, academia, and the private sector in safeguarding critical infrastructure. We will draw upon the U.S. experience as a case study, exploring strategies and best practices.\nBackground\nIn the U.S. there are 16 sectors designated by the federal government as critical infrastructure. The U.S. Congress created a new agency in 2018, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), with a mission to build the national capacity to defend against physical and cyberattacks against these 16 sectors. This is a monumental task. It is frequently acknowledged that the weakest link in cybersecurity is people. Statistics show that 95% of cybersecurity breaches are human error. The best way to mitigate that vulnerability is through education and training. Using the U.S. as a case study, this talk will generate a discussion on the role of cybersecurity education and training across governmental agencies, through academia, and in the private sector to protect critical infrastructure. \nSpeaker\nMary S. Bell, Ph.D., Dean, The Beacom College of Computer and Cyber Sciences Dakota State University\nDr. Mary Bell is Dean of The Beacom College of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Dakota State University. She was previously a Professor at the National Defense University (NDU) where she started teaching in 2010. At NDU she served as a department head of the Joint Advanced Warfighting School Operational Art and Campaign Planning Field of Study. While there, she also created an elective on cyberspace, intelligence, information, and space considerations. She has 34 years of leadership experience in both the Department of Defense and academia including 13 years of teaching experience with 11 years at the graduate level and two at the undergraduate level. She has over 20 years of service in the U.S. Army with experience in Aviation and Intelligence.\nThe speaker will be presenting from Clarion Hotel in Stockholm.\nDay and time\nSeptember 29, 08.00 - 09.00 am.

Det handlar om att balansera många olika jourlinjer, ST-utbildningar med specifika kompetensmål, tillgänglighet till operationslokaler, dygnet-runtbemanning, långsiktig kompetensförsörjning, och mycket mer. För närvarande sker detta manuellt, och det kräver att överläkare lägger 20-40% av sin heltid varje månad för att lägga pusslet!\n \nDitt Nätverk och Input Är Avgörande\nDin kunskap och input är ovärderlig för att lösa de utmaningar som vården står inför när det gäller nuvarande bemanningsprocesser och de potentiellt enorma samhällsekonomiska vinsterna som kan göras genom att förbättra och automatisera dessa processer. Vi tror att du, som har en stark bakgrund inom visualisering eller AI, kan bidra med att hitta eller utveckla lösningar för att tackla utmaningen. \n \nDeltagare – Hjältarna I Lösningen\nVar med och arbeta kreativt med andra för att lösa detta utmanande problem. Under workshopen kommer vi att samarbeta för att identifiera och utveckla innovativa lösningar för framtidens bemanning och kompetensförsörjning inom vården.\n \nProblem Som Kommer Lösas\nEn behovsanalys kommer att presenteras där insikter i hur schemaläggning inom vården ser ut idag, vad som anses viktigt, och vilka önskemål som finns inför framtiden. Behovsanalysen kommer att utgöra grunden för vår diskussion om framtidens schemaläggning.\nIdag sker schemaläggningen och planeringen av långsiktig kompetensförsörjning inom vården huvudsakligen manuellt av vårdutbildad personal. Detta innebär att de inte kan ägna sig åt direkt vård av patienter. Västra Götalandsregionen behöver effektivare verktyg för att förenkla schemaläggningen och därigenom frigöra mer tid åt vårdpersonal för att ägna sig åt patientnära arbete.\nVästra Götalandsregionen står också inför att påbörja arbetet med att upphandla mjukvara som ska underlätta schemaläggning inom hela regionen. Resultaten från denna workshop kommer att utgöra värdefull input till detta arbete.\nResultat från workshopen kommer delges i kommande RFI (Request for information) inför eventuellt kommande upphandling.\nVi ser fram emot en givande och produktiv workshop tillsammans med dig. Din input är avgörande för att forma framtiden för bemanning och kompetensförsörjning inom vården.\nVarmt välkommen!\nAnmäl dig"}

While increasing numbers of models are becoming openly available, the most capable models remain closed, and open models are limited in their coverage of smaller languages. This presentation introduces open GPT-3 -like models for Finnish, including monolingual models of sizes up to 13B parameters trained from scratch and a 176B-parameter multilingual model created by continuing the training of the largest BLOOM model. The talk will cover challenges and solutions in collecting sufficient data for training, data preprocessing and cleaning, training on the LUMI supercomputer, and the introduction of new evaluation datasets, and conclude with discussion of ongoing and future work building on the models.\nSign me up!\nRecordings of previous NLP Seminars can be found here.\nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features a 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by a discussion.

While crimes such as fraud using deep fakes, hijacking identities or using false senders of emails are increasing, digital tools for combating crime are becoming more advanced. The development of new technologies, such as AI, can provide the Police with new powerful tools and methods to investigate and solve crimes, and for finding and arresting cybercriminals. This challenge aims at finding new ways to use AI for solving crimes, which could result in resources that will be used by the forensics teams at the Police!\nThe challenge\nThe mission is to help the Swedish Police (National Forensics Center) to develop new and exciting ways to work smarter and better with digital assistants. The goal is to create useful tools using AI to make the police and NFC work more efficiently in forensic investigations solving crimes.\nYou do not need to be an AI expert, or programming-ace to win - it is the team's creativity and engagement that will be rewarded, and all you need to participate is a standard laptop/computer.\nMore about the challenge can be found here.\nMore about the prize can be found here.\nTimeline\n\nWant to be part of the next cohort of the Young Talent Program?

Oavsett om det handlar om att lösa gamla problem eller fånga helt nya möjligheter kan AI många gånger erbjuda helt nya lösningar. Men hur tar man sig från ett behov som finns till en konkret idé om hur det ska lösas?\nI ett webbinarium den 24 april, 13-15, får du och dina kollegor möjlighet att hitta svaret på den frågan – genom att ställa några andra frågor till er själva.\nPontus Wärnestål, biträdande professor med fokus på digital tjänsteinnovation vid Högskolan i Halmstad, och Anna Petersson, innovationschef på innovationsarenan HighFive, har tillsammans utvecklat en process för idégenerering inom ramen för AI. I ett webbinarium som arrangeras i samverkan med AI Sweden och Vinnovas projekt Kraftsamling för artificiell intelligens i kommuner och civilsamhälle, kommer de guida deltagarna genom en komprimerad version av den processen.\nMålgruppen är landets kommuner och organisationer i civilsamhället. Som deltagare behöver du inte vara insatt i AI som teknik – det viktigaste är att du är intresserad. Syftet är att visa hur en organisation kan arbeta med idégenerering genom att svara på ett antal frågor som handlar om behov och möjligheter. Kanske kommer några av deltagarna komma hela vägen fram, till en ny konkret idé. Men alla kommer lämna med nya tankar om hur en idéprocess kan se ut.\nStörst utväxling på webbinariet får du om du anmäler dig tillsammans med en eller flera kollegor. Men det går också att följa det på egen hand.\nWebbinariet är kostnadsfritt.\nAnmäl dig här"}

We study its impact on text summarization, focusing on the classic benchmark domain of news summarization. First, we investigate how zero-shot GPT-3 compares against fine-tuned models trained on large summarization datasets. We show that not only do humans overwhelmingly prefer GPT-3 summaries, but these also do not suffer from common dataset-specific issues such as poor factuality. Next, we study what this means for evaluation, particularly the role of gold standard test sets. Our experiments show that both reference-based and reference-free automatic metrics, e.g. recently proposed QA- or entailment-based factuality approaches, cannot reliably evaluate zero-shot summaries. Finally, we discuss future research challenges beyond generic summarization, specifically, keyword- and aspect-based summarization, showing how dominant fine-tuning approaches compare to zero-shot prompting.\nSign me up! \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

To predict the benefit of scale empirically, we argue for a more rigorous methodology based on the extrapolation loss, instead of reporting the best-fitting (interpolating) parameters. We then present a recipe for estimating scaling law parameters reliably from learning curves. We demonstrate that it extrapolates more accurately than previous methods in a wide range of architecture families across several domains, including image classification, neural machine translation (NMT) and language modeling, in addition to tasks from the BIG-Bench evaluation benchmark. To accelerate research in this domain, we also release a benchmark dataset comprising of 92 evaluation tasks. Finally, we dive in depth into our efforts to study the scaling properties of Vision Transformers by characterizing the relationships between their error rate, data, and compute, which has resulted in state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\nSign me up! \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

Current Natural Language Processing (NLP) including its fact-checking research fails to meet the expectations of real-life scenarios. In this talk, we show why the past work on fact-checking has not yet led to truly useful tools for managing misinformation, and discuss our ongoing work on more realistic solutions. NLP systems are expensive in terms of financial cost, computation, and manpower needed to create data for the learning process. With that in mind, we are pursuing research on detection of emerging misinformation topics to focus human attention on the most harmful, novel examples. Automatic methods for claim verification rely on large, high-quality datasets. To this end, we have constructed two corpora for fact checking, considering larger evidence documents and pushing the state of the art closer to the reality of combating misinformation. We further compare the capabilities of automatic, NLP-based approaches to what human fact checkers actually do, uncovering critical research directions for the future. To edify false beliefs, we are collaborating with cognitive scientists and psychologists to automatically detect and respond to attitudes of vaccine hesitancy, encouraging anti-vaxxers to change their minds with effective communication strategies.\nSign me up! \n\n \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

Many recent NLP works take a question-answering (QA) perspective to this question, under which understanding a text means the ability to accurately answer questions about it. While this approach is useful, it can also be misleading: some questions are easier than others, some questions can be answered without access to the text at all, and, furthermore, questions often leak information about the answer. Thus, determining understanding based on question-answering ability alone is not sufficient. Indeed, many QA datasets are now considered \"solved\" by deep learning systems, while it should be clear that these systems do not really understand the text.\nIn this talk I highlight deficiencies of QA for measuring text understanding, and also introduce a new NLP task we devised---together with a large corresponding dataset---which I argue serves as a much stronger indicator of text understanding than QA is. Beyond being a benchmark for text understanding, the task is also linguistically grounded, and is a very useful building block for downstream text processing applications.\nYoav Goldberg will give his talk on site at the AI Sweden office on Fleminggatan 41, Stockholm.\nSign me up! \n \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

To meet this development and to promote cooperation and collaborations both internally between the university's faculties and departments, and with external organizations, Linköping University has created the AI ​​Initiative. In order to increase contact surfaces both internally and externally, the AI Initiative in collaboration with AI Sweden arranges LiU SAI, a seminar series with presentations from both prominent academics and representatives of leading organizations. This spring, presentations were arranged with the Security Service (SÄPO), the Department of Infrastructure and the Swedish central bank (Riksbanken), and we look forward to an autumn with more exciting events.\nLiU SAI is therefore very happy to be able to invite you to a workshop on digital transformation with the world-leading truck manufacturer Volvo. At the event, Thomas Nordenskjöld and Niklas Samuelsson will present and discuss how Volvo uses AI technology/analytics to, for example, optimize the company's logistics flows.\nThe event is divided into two parts, first an overall presentation about Volvo's work with AI as decision support and then group discussions to discuss AI from a technical and organizational perspective. The group discussing AI from a technical perspective will discuss how to use AI technology for decision support in, for example, logistics, while the organizational perspective will discuss Volvo's experiences in becoming a data-driven organization.\nThe event will be organized in the Zenit house on October 3 at 2.30 pm and will be held in English.\n \n\nSign up!\nAll events will be open for academia, industry and the general public. However, the specific target groups, technical depth and language will vary from event to event. All the events will be recorded and available to watch afterwards."}

Advances in representation learning are making it increasingly possible to train end-to-end models, even for complex tasks and with little supervision. We are increasingly also seeing multi-task models that perform well on a variety of tasks. In this talk I will review work in this area carried out at Google Research over the last couple of years and draw attention to some exciting results demonstrating that models can benefit from task descriptions and side information expressed in natural language, opening up opportunities for more \"natural\" interactions with natural language processing systems.\nSign me up! \n \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

Ariel Ekgren, AI Research Scientist på AI Sweden, kommer att ge oss kort bakgrund om fältet, vart vi står i Sverige idag och hur AI för text och GPT-SW3 kan användas. \n \nKraftsamling AI för kommuner\nMånga aktörer satsar nu på att stärka offentlig sektors AI-förmåga. Även AI Sweden har identifierat behovet hos denna målgrupp för att accelerera användningen av AI i Sverige. I samband med att Vinnova står i startgroparna med att öppna en ny kommunsatsning startar AI Sweden en satsning på kommuner och krokar arm med Vinnova för en kraftsamling med målet att stärka kommuners kapacitet och förmåga att tillgodogöra sig möjligheterna med artificiell intelligens. Viktoria Josefsson, AI Sweden, med flera, kommer att berätta om en kommande kraftsamling gentemot kommuner och civilsamhälle som inkluderar öppna utlysningar och support för kommuner att komma igång med sin AI resa.\n\n \nRegion Gävleborg\nRegion Gävleborg befinner sig i startgroparna på en lång utvecklingsresa för att öka tillämpningen av AI i flera olika verksamheter. Regionen använder idag AI i enskilda tillämpningar, ex för att planera strålning i cancerbehandling. I dessa står ofta leverantörerna själva för de stora datamängderna som ligger till grund för AI-beräkningarna. Men genom flera stora utvecklingsinitiativ siktar regionen på att kraftigt öka den egna förmågan att samla in och bearbeta stora datavolymer som kan utgöra grunden för breddinförande av AI-tillämpningar för ex. avvikelsedetektion, prediktioner och beslutsstöd i icke regelbaserade sammanhang. IT-direktör Markus Bylund berättar mer om regionens förväntningar på ett aktivt deltagande som partner i AI Sweden som viktig komponent i den planerade AI-resan.\n \nDag och tid: 18 maj, 09.00-12.00Plats: Online, länken till mötet kommer i din bokningsbekräftelse\n \nAnmälan"}

This has implications in many situations. In this lecture I will try to make this concrete by looking at a few constructions that we are working with. I will start with a classification task from ECG interpretation and then continue to the more under-researched area of how to formulate and solve regression problems using deep learning. There are currently several different approaches used for deep regression and there is still room for innovation. I will illustrate this landscape in general and introduce our rather general deep regression method which has a clear probabilistic interpretation. We show good performance on several computer vision regression tasks, system identification problems and 3D object detection using laser data.\nBio: Thomas B. Schön is the Beijer Professor Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University. In 2018, he was elected to The Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (IVA) and The Royal Society of Sciences at Uppsala. He received the Tage Erlander prize for natural sciences and technology in 2017 and the Arnberg prize in 2016, both awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (KVA). He was awarded the best PhD thesis award by The European Association for Signal Processing in 2013.

Near-term forecasts of environmental outcomes can inform real-time decision making by providing predicted future conditions with associated uncertainty. In this talk, we describe our approach of combining process-guided deep learning models with a data assimilation algorithm to generate 7-day forecasts of maximum stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin to support New York City reservoir management decisions. We evaluate the forecast accuracy and reliability during the summer of 2021 and discuss future workflow and model improvements to better deliver valuable information in support of environmental management decisions.\nBio: Jake Zwart (he/him) is a data scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the Data Science Branch of the Water Mission Area. Jake's work currently focuses on producing short-term forecasts of stream temperature at regional scales to aid in water resources decision making. The data science group at USGS has developed techniques to inject scientific knowledge into machine learning models (process-guided deep learning) to make accurate predictions\nAttend"}

In this work, we tackle one specific case where the model assigns a high probability to unreasonably short sequences. We define the oversmoothing rate to quantify this issue. After confirming the high degree of oversmoothing in neural machine translation, we propose to explicitly minimize the oversmoothing rate during training. We conduct a set of experiments to study the effect of the proposed regularization on both model distribution and decoding performance.\nWe use a neural machine translation task as the testbed and consider three different datasets of varying size. Our experiments reveal three major findings. First, we can control the oversmoothing rate of the model by tuning the strength of the regularization. Second, by enhancing the oversmoothing loss contribution, the probability and the rank of  token decrease heavily at positions where it is not supposed to be. Third, the proposed regularization impacts the outcome of beam search especially when a large beam is used. The degradation of translation quality (measured in BLEU) with a large beam significantly lessens with lower oversmoothing rate, but the degradation compared to smaller beam sizes remains to exist. From these observations, we conclude that the high degree of oversmoothing is the main reason behind the degenerate case of overly probable short sequences in a neural autoregressive model.\nSpeaker: Kyunghyun Cho, New York University.\nAttend"}

The maximal subsets of the input space on which the network function is linear are called linear regions. If we want to better understand ReLU networks, it may be beneficial to understand these regions. There is the common intuition that the number of linear regions of neural networks measures their expressivity. Therefore a lot of focus has been placed on trying to obtain estimates of this number. However, this number is staggeringly high: Even very small networks have many more linear regions than there are atoms in the universe (10^80). This number is also much larger than the number of points in the dataset.\nThis raises the question of how representative the number of linear regions is for network performance and how information extracted from training samples passes on to the many linear regions free of data for successful generalisation to test data. Our approach differs from previous ones focused on counting in that it investigates the linear coefficients associated to the linear linear regions. We propose TropEx, a tropical algebra-based algorithm extracting linear terms of the network function. This allows us to compare the network function with an extracted tropical function that agrees with the original network around all training data points, but which has much fewer linear regions. We also use our algorithm to compare different network types from the perspective of linear regions and their coefficients.\nSpeaker: Martin Trimmel, Lund University.\nAttend"}

These models outclass several natural language understanding tasks, and despite this they cannot answer basic questions relating to multiplication, how to get a table through a doorway or what the color of a dove is. Arguments that recently have arisen claim that this is expected, since a model that only ever has seen text cannot be expected to understand the meaning behind the words it sees, since the meaning lies somewhere outside of text. Thus, these powerful language models have recently been referred to as “stochastic parrots”. \nA way that has been proposed to mitigate this issue is to connect the model with more information than text, such as images, sounds and effects of actions, that may provide the meaning behind the text. This is also referred to as “grounding the model\"\". The proposed setup is not entirely dissimilar to how humans can read and write, but also interact with the outside world, by e.g. being able to see and hear.

While these are important dichotomies, in this talk I will argue that we should put more focus on another: parametric vs non-parametric modelling. Roughly, in the former a fixed set of parameters is used, in the latter parameters grow with data. I will explain recent advances in knowledge intensive NLP from this perspective, show the benefit of hybrid approaches, and discuss KBs as non-parametric approaches with relatively crude assumptions about what future information needs will be. By replacing these assumptions with a learnt model, we show that such “modern KBs” are a very attractive alternative or complement to current approaches.\n \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

These models retain many of the features of their components (like zero-shot capabilities or OCR) and bring them into a multimodal space. In this presentation we will be looking at technical model capabilities and discuss pressing questions like alignment and fairness, and how to understand and use these models towards a new way for humans and machines to interact.\nSign me up!\n \nBy practitioners, for practitioners\nEach seminar features an initial 45-minute presentation by practitioners or researchers followed by discussion.

However, until recently, such systems remained “narrow specialists” incapable of generalizing to a wide range of diverse tasks without being specifically trained on them.\nThis situation started to change recently due to advances in very large-scale self-supervised models (also called “foundation  models”) pretrained on large amounts of diverse data (e.g., 175B-parameter GPT-3 language model, multimodal CLIP, DALL-E, and others). Scaling such models lead to emergence of impressive few-shot generalization capabilities with respect to broad sets of novel tasks. These advances, considered by many a breakthrough that can pave the way towards achieving the ultimate goal of AI, Artificial General Intelligence, became possible due to  significant increase in compute available to industrial research labs such as OpenAI, Google and others. Furthermore, recently discovered empirical neural scaling laws predict such performance improvements, governed by power-laws, as the model size and the  amounts of data and compute increase. While these recent developments are truly exciting, they also pose a new  challenge to academic and non-profit AI research organizations which may not have access to a similar amount of compute that industry has.  This motivated us – a rapidly growing international collaboration across several Universities and non-profit organizations, including Mila/University of Montreal, EleutherAI, LAION, AI Sweden and several others – to join forces and initiate an  effort on developing common objectives and tools for developing large-scale foundation models, and exploring  computing resources that can be available to non-profit and academia, such as supercomputers in particular countries.\nOur long-term, overarching goal is to develop a wide international collaboration united by the objective of building foundation models that are increasingly more powerful, while at the same time safe, robust and aligned with human values. Such models aim to serve as a foundation for numerous AI applications, from industry to healthcare to scientific discovery – i.e., AI-powered applications of great societal value.\n \nSign me up!"}

This is especially so when it comes to the use of AI in public decision-making, such as when AI is used to determine whether someone should get a loan at the bank, or whether they should get social security benefits at the social services.\nOne of the main ideas expressed in the debate about AI in public decision-making is that these processes need to be open somehow to be legitimate, and that the opaqueness of AI systems (as opposed to human ones) poses specific challenges in this regard. In this talk, de Fine Licht will discuss how we can (and cannot) use transparency to increase legitimacy when using AI in public decision-making.\nDecember 14, 13:15-14:15 (Swedish time)\nRead more and sign up"}

Optical measurement systems have the ability to generate large amounts of data, which is a prerequisite for being able to build good AI solutions. If the technologies are used together, new types of value adding solutions can be developed.\nMany of us use optical measurement technology on a daily basis, without thinking about it.

Equally irrefutable are the societal, legal, ethical, geopolitical, and policy challenges that AI technologies have brought to the fore – aspects of which might not have existed just a few years or even a few months ago. Governments, civil societies, and the private sector around the globe are engaged in active conversations and collaborations to determine where and how AI fits into existing norms and regulatory frameworks or where new ones are needed.\nThis talk will provide an overview of the U.S. Department of State’s policies, priorities, and activities in AI, and in general, how the United States government is engaged in policies that promote the trustworthy and responsible design, development, and deployment of AI in line with democratic values and respect for human rights. Additionally, the speaker will share his thoughts on areas of collaboration and opportunities between Sweden and the United States.\nRaj Madhavan is an executive AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow and Program Analyst with the U.S. Department of State’s Division for International Communications and Information Policy in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs where he is actively involved in the formulation, coordination, and oversight of policy related to emerging technologies, ICTs, and digital economy.\n \nSign up"}

However, as with all great opportunities it is important to understand where the pitfalls lie. Legislative bodies are already looking at launching rules and regulations relating to AI & Ethics and hence it is of huge importance for businesses to start deep-diving into what this means for their organisation and AI.

Globalization, urbanization, climate change, and ecological pressures increase the risk and impact of future pandemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exemplified several of these issues. The social, economic, and health impact of the pandemic has been immense and will continue to be felt for decades to come. \nComputation, computational platforms, computational thinking and lens can play a multi-faceted role in reorganizing, augmenting and supporting global real-time epidemic science and the rapid translation to practical public health systems. Since February 2020, our group has been providing local, state, and federal authorities continuous modeling and analytics support to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. \n​In this talk, using COVID-19 as an exemplar, I will describe how scalable computing, AI and data science can play an important role in advancing real-time epidemic science. Our recent results on vaccine prioritization strategies to contain the pandemic will be used to illustrate some of these ideas.\nAbout the Speaker: Madhav Marathe is a Distinguished Professor in Biocomplexity, the division director of the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing Division at the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative, and a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia (UVA). His research interests are in network science, computational epidemiology, AI, foundations of computing and high performance computing. Over the last 20 years, his division has supported federal and state authorities in their effort to combat epidemics in real-time, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Before joining UVA, he held positions at Virginia Tech and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, SIAM and AAAS.\nRead more and sign up here"}

Today, this system needs to be monitored and regulated by operating technicians. A desire has emerged to be able to partially control this system through AI in order to be able to detect and handle the need for corrections, which would otherwise require a operations technician. Together with IoT World, Test bed Ebbepark is working on a project to find solutions on how AI can support the goal of lower energy consumption. The project can lead to a faster regulation - which will reduce energy consumption in the area, a reduced load on the energy system in general, lower costs for residents and operators in the area.\nAt this workshop, we will present a feasibility study done on the subject, and we will then jointly discuss possible approaches to projects that could take Test bed Ebbepark further. You as a participant can suggest technology, project layouts, demonstrators etc that could be implemented within the framework of IoT World where your company is responsible for a larger or smaller part of the project.\nThis workshop will be held in Swedish.\n\nRead more and sign up here"}

Jordan is the Pehong Chen Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests bridge the computational, statistical, cognitive and biological sciences, and have focused in recent years on Bayesian nonparametric analysis, probabilistic graphical models, spectral methods, kernel machines and applications to problems in distributed computing systems, natural language processing, signal processing and statistical genetics. Prof. Jordan is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has been named a Neyman Lecturer and a Medallion Lecturer by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. He received the IJCAI Research Excellence Award in 2016, the David E. Rumelhart Prize in 2015 and the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award in 2009.

The number of tasks that AI will perform in lieu of humans is growing, and the count will include highly complex cognitive activities. Innovation is one of these, fundamentally relying on the generation of novel ideas and solutions to wicked problems. If problem solving is delegated to machines and algorithms, what kind of thinking and value is left for humans in innovation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranged by: \n\n\nStockholm School Of Economics\nSwedish Centre for Digital Innovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt The Garden of the SSE House of Innovation, we share what the luminary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi proposed in the 1980s: in AI-powered organizations and societies, humans become problem finders, ultimately responsible for defining which problems make sense to address. Clearly, the search for problems worth solving is guided by purpose, by what is meaningful to us as individual human beings, and by what an organization stands for, its values and identity. How can a focus on purpose be more than a vague aspiration with little impact on value, and instead drive innovation for real?\nThe 2020 edition of the Dialogues in The Garden is an exciting deep-dive at the intersection between innovation, leadership, and design. Connect with us and participate in a vibrant conversation on the role of purpose in problem finding, on its translation into actual economic and social value through novel reframing techniques, on the benefits that design offers in reflecting and acting with purpose, and on the impact of AI. \nAround the table, presenting insights and steering the conversation, you will find Roberto Verganti and Mattia Bianchi, professors and directors of The Garden, as well as corporate leaders who are actively working in this area, as well as our most talented graduate students, who critically drive what SSE does and why!

Not only has AI become a focal point in the industrial and consumer consciousness, but it has also been placed at the top of many national agendas, with countries investing billions in this technology. In particular, the EU as well as research funding organisations are allocating considerable resources to the study of AI, and many countries are actively pursuing national initiatives in this area.\nThe practical use of AI raises many questions and there are many predictions about its future applications: some people imagine AI as the future of mankind while others see it as an existential threat (great threat to society?). There are opportunities and obstacles and many legal, ethical and technical issues. Law in the Era of AI addresses the rapid development of AI from multiple perspectives.\nThe Conference is divided into four blocks:\n1. Data Protection\n2. Transparency\n3. Liability\n4. How to Regulate?\nThe blocks begin with presentations of speakers with different backgrounds and extensive experience concerning the addressed issues. Several international experts will participate. In addition to drawing a picture of where we stand today, each block will include a moderated discussion.\nRead more and sign up here"}

These networks require an adaptive critic function while training, to teach the generator network how to improve its performance. To achieve this, the critic needs to measure how close generated samples are to true samples, and to provide a useful gradient signal the generator network.\nI will explore the design of critic functions for GANs, including f-divergences as used in the original GAN design, and integral probability metrics (such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy) as used in later GANs.

State-of-the-art machine learning models based on deep learning often fail under such adverse conditions. So, how can we build Natural Language Processing technology which transfers better to new conditions, such as learning to process a new language, learning to answer new types of questions, or learning with uncertainty stemming from human labelling? In this talk, I will present some recent work to address these ubiquitous challenges using neural networks in NLP. In particular, I will include work on cross-lingual learning for NLP and work at the interface of language and vision. \nAbout the speaker:\nBarbara Plank is Associate Professor of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the Computer Science Department at ITU (IT University of Copenhagen) where she leads a research lab in natural language processing.​​​\nRead more and register here\n \nAbout Chalmers AI Talks\nA seminar series with inspiring talks from internationally acclaimed experts on artificial intelligence.\nCome listen to world-renowned leaders in computer science, machine learning and statistics  discuss on a wide range of perspectives on how AI will affect research, business and society. This seminar series is an initiative of the Chalmers AI Research Centre (CHAIR).\n\n​"}

With the demand for \"explainable AI\" there is a risk that automation and improvement driven by new technology stops or is hindered.\nThe trust model, that will be presented on this seminar, is intended to describe and report on an AI application's ability and knowledge to perform a task and through this serve as a quality stamp that provides clarity and transparency to authorities' automated measures.

The series speaker this time is Francis Lee, Associate Professor and researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, at the Division of Science, Technology and Society with the theme: The problem with FAT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) -\nChallenging the auditing perspective on algorithms through situated analysis​\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranged by: \n\n\nCHAIR Chalmers AI Research Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: \nIn the social study of algorithms there is a worrying trend to reduce algorithms to coherent and stable objects whose computational logic can be audited for \nbiases to create fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAT). To counter this reductionist and determinist tendency, this article proposes an analytical strategy which examines algorithms as multi-situated to highlight situated agencies and situated opacities. Empirically, the article follows the algorithmic enactment of a pandemic—the recent Zika outbreak—at the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.  \nA key argument in the article is that we, as social analysts of algorithms, need to attend to how multiple spaces for agency, opacity, and computational power open and close in different parts of algorithmic assemblages. The heart of the matter is that actors experience different degrees of agency and opacity in different parts of any algorithmic assemblage. Consequently, rather than auditing algorithms for biased logic, the article shows the usefulness of examining calculative power as enacted and situated. \nAbout the speaker, Francis Lee: \n\nFrancis Lee is an associate professor and researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, at the Division of Science, Technology, and Society. Lee works in the interdisciplinary tradition of Science and Technology Studies and the primary research interest is focused on social and cultural aspects of digitalization and knowledge production. The work draws on sociology, media studies, anthropology, history of science, and cultural studies. Lee has written about knowledge production in the biosciences, epistemic standards in education, and exclusion in socio-technical processes. \nFrancis Lee is a member of the Editorial Board of the peer-reviewed journal Valuation Studies and a co-founder of the academic network Algorithms as Devices of Power and Valuation. Lee has published in  Science, Technology & Human Values; Science as Culture; Valuation Studies, and History and Technology among others and edited the volume Value Practices in the Life Sciences (Oxford University Press, 2015), and is currently writing a monograph titled Trials of Value, which has been contracted by Mattering Press.\n \nRead more and register!"}

We study such problems in the general form of ’undersupervised machine learning’. In particular, we consider the optimal value of i​nformation problem in the context of adaptive information acquisition, where the goal is to sequentially select a set of tests with a minimal cost, so that one can efficiently make the best decision based on the observed outcomes. Existing algorithms are either heuristics with no guarantees, or scale poorly (with exponential run time in terms of the number of available tests). Moreover, these methods assume a known distribution over the test outcomes, which is often not the case in practice. We propose a sampling-based online learning framework to address the above issues. First, assuming the distribution over hypotheses is known, we propose a dynamic hypothesis enumeration strategy, which allows efficient information gathering with strong theoretical guarantees. We show that with sufficient amount of samples, one can identify a near-optimal decision with high probability. Second, when the parameters of the hypotheses distribution are unknown, we propose an algorithm that learns the parameters progressively via posterior sampling in an online fashion. We further establish a rigorous bound on the expected regret. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world interactive troubleshooting application, and show that one can efficiently make high-quality decisions with low cost.\n \n \nAbout the speaker:\nMorteza Haghir Chehreghani is Associate Professor of AI and Machine Learning at Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science and AI division.

In this series of AI short talks Karinne Ramirez-Amaro Assistant Professor at the department of Electrical Engineering at Chalmers, will handle the subjetct: AI meets Robotics - Robots that Reason about Human Activities. The first series of CHAIR Spotlight on Research talks have the theme “New Chalmers researchers on the spot!”, meaning that researchers that came to Chalmers in the last three years are giving these talks. ​​​\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranged by: \n\n\nChalmers AI Research Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAutonomous robots are expected to learn new skills and to re-use past experiences in different situations as efficient, intuitive and reliable as possible. Robots need to adapt to different sources of information, for example, videos, robot sensors, virtual reality, etc. Then, to advance the research in the understanding of human activities, in robotics, the development of learning methods that adapt to different sensors are needed. In this talk, I will introduce a novel learning method that generates compact and general semantic models to infer human activities. This learning method allows robots to obtain and determine a higher-level understanding of a demonstrator’s behavior via semantic representations. First, the low-level information is extracted from the sensory data, then a meaningful semantic description, the high-level, is obtained by reasoning about the intended human behaviors. The introduced method has been assessed on different robots, e.g. the iCub, REEM-C, PR2, and TOMM, with different kinematic chains and dynamics. Furthermore, the robots use different perceptual modalities, under different constraints and in several scenarios ranging from making a sandwich to driving a car assessed on different domains (home-service and industrial scenarios). One important aspect of our approach is its scalability and adaptability toward new activities, which can be learned on-demand. Overall, the presented compact and flexible solutions are suitable to tackle complex and challenging problems for autonomous robots.\nAbout the speaker:\nDr. Karinne Ramirez Amaro is an Assistant professor at Chalmers University of Technology since September 2019.

Due to the diverse physical-layer effects of different attack techniques and the limitations and sparse placement of optical performance monitoring devices, such attacks are difficult to detect and their signatures are unknown. However, coherent receivers with digital signal processing capabilities can provide elaborate optical monitoring data collected at the destination node of each connection, and machine learning techniques can give an unprecedented insight into the intricate relationships among the various signal parameters. \nThis talk presents a machine learning framework for detection and identification of physical-layer attacks, based on experimental attack traces from an operator field-deployed testbed subjected to in-band jamming, out-of-band jamming, and polarization modulation attacks with varying intensities. We evaluate different ML techniques in terms of their accuracy, robustness to missing features, and scalability in processing experimental data. We discuss the performance and suitability of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques, as well as their embedding into the network service lifecycle. We also investigate challenges related to the integration of these techniques in real-life network management systems.\n \nAbout the speaker:\nDr. Furdek is an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Chalmers. She received her Docent degree in Optical Networking from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2017. Her research focuses on the design of high-performance networks supporting next generation services, encompassing issues related to the optical network architecture and control.

Input from universities and research institutes involved in artificial intelligence research in Norway has been collected, and international and national reports and guidelines have been reviewed. The aim has been to facilitate ethical good and responsible AI research in Norway. This talk will summarize the findings in the report and also include relevant examples from own and others work.\nOn November 11, the committee, represented by Tørresen, presented its report, which was commented on by a number of key players in artificial intelligence research in Norway. The nine considerations in the report are intended to serve as a starting point for reflection, guidance and discussion in the research communities. They are also prepared for actors who finance and facilitate AI research, or who use AI. The talk will present the described considerations and how they are relevant in research and development. Tørresen has been central to the work since he himself is an active researcher within the KI.\nJim Tørresen is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oslo, Norway where he leads the Robotics and Intelligent System research group.  He has worked with artificial intelligence for over 20 years through teaching, research and had responsibility for a number of externally funded research projects. He is currently project manager or principal investigator in three Research Council of Norway projects and the RITMO Centre of Excellence for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Technology and is also a member of the National Research Ethics Committee for Science and Technology (NENT) and their working group which has investigated research ethics aspects of AI.\n\nAbout AI ETHICS at Chalmers\nA  series of seminars highlighting ethical perspectives of artificial intelligence.

The success can to a large extent be attributed to breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and in particular deep learning. ML algorithms have had remarkable success in automating tasks that are easy to accomplish but difficult to formalize by humans, for example, image analysis, natural language processing, voice and face recognition.\nOn the other hand, the field of Operations Research (OR) has been successful in developing methodologies to solve efficiently various types of decision problems that can be formalized but are nevertheless too complex or time consuming for humans to process. These methodologies are crucial to a wealth of applications. \nIn this talk we give a brief introduction to ML and OR with a special focus on novel AI methodologies at the intersection between ML and discrete optimization. We give a high-level presentation of such a methodology where OR and ML complement each other to address an overall decision problem that could not be solved otherwise. It is applied to a container loading problem faced by North American railroads. \nThe talk will be held by Emma Frejinger, Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research at Université de Montréal.\nThe event is free of charge, but your registration is needed.\nRead more and register here"}

Risk-based approaches to engendering trust, in the form of argument-based safety cases, have shown promise for the assurance and subsequent operational approval of novel systems.\nHowever, LECs pose particular challenges for certification, as does the gap between the state of the art in safety assurance, and how aviation systems are certified in practice. Towards straddling this gap, we are developing the dynamic assurance case (DAC) concept as a model-based, multifaceted approach to the assurance of LEC-based systems. Our vision is one of a rich, expressive, and formally-founded framework, going well beyond how argument-based safety cases are currently developed. In particular, besides recording assurance rationale in a modular fashion, DACs: i) capture assurance policies and a conforming assurance architecture, ii) provide a framework for assurance quantification, and iii) also supply the means to admit design-time verification and validation (V&V) evidence, along with run-time evidence from operational monitoring.\n\nTime: Monday June 17, 14:30-15:30, followed by coffee and cookies.Place: Lecture room EL41, EDIT building, Maskingränd 2\n\nWelcome!

Machine learning, i.e. derivation of computational models from data, has already made important contributions to predict and understand components of the Earth system, specifically in climate, remote sensing and environmental sciences. For instance, classifications of land cover types, prediction of land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere exchange, or detection of extreme events have greatly benefited from these approaches. Such data-driven information has already changed how Earth system models are evaluated and further developed.\nHowever, many studies have not yet sufficiently addressed and exploited dynamic aspects of systems, such as memory effects for prediction and effects of spatial context, e.g. for classification and change detection. In particular new developments in deep learning offer great potential to overcome these limitations.\nYet, a key challenge and opportunity is to integrate (physical-biological) system modeling approaches with machine learning into hybrid modeling approaches, which combines physical consistency and machine learning versatility. A couple of examples are given, where the combination of system-based and machine-learning-based modelling helps our understanding of aspects of the Earth system.\nAbout Markus Reichstein\nMarkus Reichstein is director of the Biogeochemical Integration Department at the Max-Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Professor for Global Geoecology at the FSU Jena, and Director at the Michael-Stifel-Center Jena for Data-driven and Simulation Science in Jena.\nHis main research interests include the effect of climate variability/extreme and change on global ecosystems, in particular carbon and water cycles. He and his research group tackle these topics by combining experimental, ground- and satellite-based observations with machine-learning based data-driven and process-oriented system models in a model-data integration approach. Prof. Reichstein has authored >185 publications and has been part of the iLEAPS/IGBP Scientific Steering Committee, and lead author of the IPCC special report on Climate Extremes (SREX).\nCurrently he is serving as member of the Thuringian panel on climate change, and chairing the Future Earth/IRDR/WCRP Knowledge Action Network “Extreme events and emergent Risks”. In 2013 he was awarded with the Max-Planck Research Award by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation, and in 2018 the Piers J Sellers mid-career award on Global Environmental Change by the American Geophysical Union.\nRead more and sign up here"}

The seminars are organised by the AI Ethics Committee, within Chalmers AI Research Centre. The series' first speaker is Karim Jebari from the Swedish Institute for Futures Studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranged by: \n\n\nCHAIR Chalmers AI Research Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intelligent machine surpassing human intelligence across a wide set of skills has been proposed as a possible existential catastrophe (i.e., an event comparable in value to that of human extinction). Among those concerned about existential risk related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is common to assume that AI will not only be very intelligent, but also be a general agent (i.e., an agent capable of action in many different contexts). This article explores the characteristics of machine agency, and what it would mean for a machine to become a general agent. \nIn particular, it does so by articulating some important differences between belief and desire in the context of machine agency. One such difference is that while an agent can by itself acquire new beliefs through learning, desires need to be derived from preexisting desires or acquired with the help of an external influence. Such influence could be a human programmer or natural selection. We argue that to become a general agent, a machine needs general desires, but general desires cannot sui generis be derived from non-general desires. Thus, even though general agency in AI could in principle be created, it cannot be arrived at spontaneously by an endogenous process. In conclusion, we argue that a common AI scenario, where general agency suddenly emerges in a non-general agent AI, is not plausible.\nAbout Karim Jebari Karim Jebari is a researcher at the Institute for Futures Studies. He defended his doctoral thesis in December 2014 at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The thesis is about applied ethics and in particular how we should relate to the risks and opportunities of technological innovation. Photo: Sara Moritz\nPlace: Lecture Hall Palmstedt, university building, Chalmersplatsen 2, Campus Johanneberg\nWelcome!

This has raised concerns about the ethics and fairness of such systems: If a person applies for a loan, are they more likely to get it if they are male, despite controlling for income and background? If a risk scoring system is used to triage patients, will it prefer patients of certain ethnicities? These concerns have proven well-founded. In 2016, it was found that an AI system used for bail decisions in the USA was underestimating the probability of white criminals reoffending and overestimating the probability for black criminals.\nIn this seminar, we survey research that attempts to define algorithmic fairness and bias, as well as the means taken to improve this aspect of AI systems. We discuss the fundamental challenges of such an endeavour and the mathematical impossibility of a system that satisfies every kind of fairness.\nPlace: Scaniasalen, lecture room, Chalmersplatsen 1, Kårhuset\nWelcome!

A segment are in the Proof of Concept mode where trials and models are run to understand the business outcomes. A very small fraction of customer are actually in production as over 60% of models developed with the intention of operationalizing them were never actually operationalized.\nHPE’s target for AI is to make it simple for the customers to bring it and maintain it in production. This is done using an end to end stack that allows the users to build using tools and libraries, train on cluster on containers or bare metal, deploy on the edge devices , monitor and maintain models. In this presentation we are going to discuss HPE’s strategy for productionizing AI.\n \n\nSorin Cheran, PhD in AI at HPE\nSorin Cheran has been supporting customers worldwide and is currently leading an involved in key AI projects.

It started as a myth, developed via mechanical calculating automata, leading to formalization of reasoning envisaged by Leibniz and his idea of universal formalized knowledge. This formalization project in logics mathematics and computing lead finally to the first electronic computers. Today’s great success of machine (deep) learning is the next essential step closer to truly intelligent machinery. It is paired with advances of cyber-physical systems which help intelligent programs directly act in the world. This combination of high-level intelligence, interacting with the physical world, learning, reasoning and making autonomous decisions, is a very new phenomenon in human history. We are still trying to find out what it will mean for societies and individuals. We would like to enjoy the benefits of AI and avoid its challenges and dangers. One of the first technologies essentially building on AI are automated cars with increasing levels of autonomy. Here the intelligent cyber-physical machine will be “in command”. How can we trust them? How can we assure they will do only what is good for us? Who will be responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of intelligent technology? Prompted by the quick development of AI in recent years, and many alarming scenarios discussed by leading philosophers, ethicists and representatives of biggest companies developing AI technologies – number of initiatives developed on different levels all over the world: AI policies, guides, recommendations, and declarations. Ethical debate is currently going very strong. At the same time there is legislative trying to catch up with technologies, such as GDPR in Europe. It is very important that we have both ethical consensus and the legal side ready as more and more advanced AI technology gets implemented. This talk will present the state of the art of the debate starting from the philosophy, ethics, technology and back, from a European perspective.\nAbout the speaker\nGordana Dodig-Crnkovic is Professor of Interaction Design at Chalmers University of Technology and Professor in Computer Science at Mälardalen University. She holds PhD degrees in Physics and Computer Science. Her main research project, supported by Swedish Research Council, on Morphological Computing in Cognitive Systems, addresses modelling cognition as natural computation. She is contributing to the research in the fields of the Study of Information as well as Information Ethics and Ethics of Technology, with focus on AI. She has long record of teaching, among others courses in Ethics, Theory of Science and Computability. She published books Investigations into Information Semantics and Ethics of Computing, (2006), Information and Computation Nets (2009) and four edited volumes (2017, 2011, 2013, 2017 and 2019) with Springer and World Scientific, with further edited volume on the study of information, to appear shortly whit World Scientific. She is past President of the International Society for the Study of Information, member of the editorial board of the World Scientific Series in Information Studies and Springer SAPERE series, and a member of the editorial board of several journals.

The talk will focus on integral probability metric (IPM) losses, specifically the Wasserstein loss as implemented in the WGAN-GP, and the MMD GAN. We will begin with an introduction to IPM losses, their relation to moment matching in the case of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and how IPMs relate to f-divergences (such as the KL and Jensen Shannon divergence, as used in the original GAN). Next, we will look at GAN design using these IPM losses, and compare with the f-divergence losses. We'll end with some conjectures on the results that would be needed to establish a “theory of GANs”: in particular, that a problem-specific critic is essential, and that the critic  needs to be deliberately weakened to ensure good GAN performance.\nRead more and sign up here"}

They are educated and boosted at AI Sweden during the fall and work at AI Sweden’s partners during the spring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner offering\nTo attract top talent to Sweden and develop our potential, diversity and a dynamic work environment will be a top priority. AI Sweden wants to provide opportunities for talented individuals based on potential, not only experience, contrary to traditional structures.\nIn August 2021, AI Sweden launched a talent program with participants newly graduated from high school (Swedish “gymnasium”). The first batch of students studied Teknikspets within AI at ABB-gymnasiet, had extensive knowledge of AI tools and frameworks, and had experience in applying AI during their studies. In 2022, the program opened up for a wider range of applicants and had participants in several locations around Sweden.\nThis year we are accepting applications from applicants from all across Sweden, as we look to expand the program nationally. The participants will be newly graduated from a technical high school program, with an interest in AI and technology. \nThe participants will be offered courses at AI Sweden during the fall, as well as take part in our different projects and get additional training from the team at AI Sweden. The studies will include deep learning, natural language processing, distributed machine learning, and autonomous systems.\nDuring spring 2023, the participants are available to work 50-100% with one of AI Sweden’s partners. Zenseact hosted two participants in January-May 2022, and four participants during the spring of 2023. They are happy with the program and impressed by the students.\n\n“The participants in the Young Talent program are incredibly competent, if I didn’t know about their background I would have guessed that they had a master’s degree. They have brought a lot of value to the whole team.” – Johnny Kemi, Engineering Manager at Zenseact\n\n→ More partner testimonials\nAre you prepared to take the step and onboard our AI talents into your organization?

The fall involves studies of different AI technologies and supporting AI Sweden’s researchers and partners. During the spring you’ll be doing real work at some of AI Sweden’s partner organizations.\nThe program is paid and you will receive compensation for your time and work.\nRead about the experiences of three young talents working with three different organizations\n\nMy idea for the program was to learn about AI, get lots of helpful contacts, secure internship opportunities and lay a strong foundation for my future career. I am happy to say that all of these goals have been achieved! - Minna Leijonhufvud, Young Talent 22/23\n\n\nThe Young Talent program is the best thing I have done in a long time. I never thought I could work with something like this so soon. - Herman Hallonqvist, Young Talent 22/23\n\nAs a participant in the Young Talent program, you will learn more about different AI and machine learning technologies, and work on real projects with AI Sweden and our partner organizations. There are no prerequisites besides having graduated high school between the years 2021 and 2023, and not having started other studies at college or university. Your willingness to learn and interest in AI, programming and/or new technologies is what matters.\n\nBesides the knowledge I have gained in for example object detection and language models, the Young Talent program has given me the opportunity to meet companies, work with extremely competent people, and explore an industry in which I will most likely work in the future. - Joakim Eriksson, Young Talent 21/22\n\n\nThe best parts of the program have been meet-ups and working on projects with different types of organizations. I have a more defined sense of what I want to work with in the future and I have already established a network with some very interesting contacts. - Victor Fagerström, Young Talent 21/22\n\nIn December 2022, some of the Young Talent program participants held the event AI for the future, where they talked about what artificial intelligence is, their experience of the program, and asked questions about AI to people in the industry. Watch the recording here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung Talents 2023/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tSofia Nguyen\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLinköping\n\n\nsofia.nguyen@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tNiels Houben\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLinköping\n\n\nniels.houben@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tFelix Folkebrant\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLinköping\n\n\nfelix.folkebrant@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tArvid Nordström\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nÖrebro\n\n\narvid.nordstrom@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tJoel Karlsson\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nÖrebro\n\n\njoel.karlsson@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tGustav Wreth\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nÖrebro\n\n\ngustav.wreth@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tValter Jakobsson\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nÖrebro\n\n\nvalter.jakobsson@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tTilda Thorin\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLund\n\n\ntilda.thorin@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tAkash Arjun\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLund\n\n\nakash.arjun@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tWilhelm Malé\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLund\n\n\nwilhelm.male@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tAdam Gimfalk\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nLund\n\n\nadam.gimfalk@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tPontus Wallin\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nEskilstuna\n\n\npontus.wallin@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tGustav Jakobsson\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nEskilstuna\n\n\ngustav.jakobsson@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\tAugust Wanger\nYoung Talent\n\nLocation: \nEskilstuna\n\n\naugust.wanger@ai.se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Sofia Hedén\n\n\nHead of Talent Programs\nsofia.heden@ai.se\n+46 (0)72-174 91 00"}

AI Sweden vill ge möjligheter för begåvade individer baserat på potential, inte bara erfarenhet, i motsats till traditionella strukturer.\nI augusti 2021 lanserade AI Sweden ett talangprogram med deltagare nyligen utexaminerade från gymnasiet. Den första kullen studenter studerade Teknikspets inom AI på ABB-gymnasiet, hade omfattande kunskaper om AI-verktyg och ramverk, och hade erfarenhet av att tillämpa AI under sina studier. År 2022 öppnade programmet upp för en bredare grupp sökande och hade deltagare på flera platser runt om i Sverige.\nI år tar vi emot ansökningar från sökande från hela Sverige, eftersom vi vill expandera programmet nationellt. Deltagarna kommer att vara nyligen utexaminerade från ett tekniskt gymnasieprogram, med intresse för AI och teknik.\nDeltagarna kommer att erbjudas kurser på AI Sweden under hösten, samt delta i våra olika projekt och få ytterligare utbildning från teamet på AI Sweden. Studierna kommer att inkludera djupinlärning, naturlig språkbehandling, distribuerad maskininlärning och autonoma system.\nUnder våren 2023 är deltagarna tillgängliga för att arbeta 50-100% med en av AI Swedens partners. Zenseact var värd för två deltagare i januari-maj 2022, och fyra deltagare under våren 2023. De är nöjda med programmet och imponerade av studenterna.\n\n“ Deltagarna i Young Talent-programmet är otroligt kompetenta, om jag inte visste om deras bakgrund skulle jag ha gissat att de hade en masterexamen.

Din vilja att lära och intresse för AI, programmering och/eller nya teknologier är det som spelar roll.\n\nFörutom den kunskap jag har fått i till exempel objektigenkänning och språkmodeller, har Young Talent-programmet gett mig möjligheten att träffa företag, arbeta med extremt kompetenta människor och utforska en bransch där jag förmodligen kommer att arbeta i framtiden. - Joakim Eriksson, Young Talent 21/22\n\n\nDe bästa delarna av programmet har varit träffar och att arbeta med projekt med olika typer av organisationer.

We can train machine learning models on locally available (i.e. decentralized) data and make local decisions. The approach enables combining knowledge from several local datasets, without distributing the actual raw data between devices, locations, and organizations. Unlike algorithms trained on a centralized dataset, decentralized learning distributes models rather than the data itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn federated learning, local models trained in edge devices are typically aggregated at a central location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate initial model\nTransmit current model to devices\nTraining on devices using local data\nTransmit local model parameters to aggregator\nAggregate parameters to create updated model\nSend latest model for further training or deployment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn swarm learning, one of the edge devices is also used as an aggregator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices register on network\nDevices receive initial model\nDevices train model on local data\nDevices share and merge models\nRepeat steps 3-4 until satisfied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of edge learning?\nTraditional centralized AI applications have evolved over the past few decades to\nreshape how we live and move. We are familiar with voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant). Active driver assistance and automated driving features are increasing in prevalence to heighten safety and reduce the load on drivers. The same trend is visible in healthcare, where assisted diagnostics are used to assist physicians in identifying and correctly diagnosing medical conditions.\nTopics such as AI ethics, data privacy, data security, data ownership, data transfer, computing, and storage costs are concerns for businesses, the public, and governments. Countries have begun to create policies that enhance local vs. global learning (e.g., Chinese data protections) or otherwise limit the long-term shared open use of data. At the same time, stakeholders are increasingly worried about AI bias and argue strongly for the need for more diversified and less restrictive modeling.\nBy moving learning to the edge, organizations can begin to collaborate globally while addressing concerns around data security, data privacy, and data transfer barriers. At the same time, they benefit from leveraging otherwise unused computational resources to solve growing problems with the shortcomings of data-starved modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge learning lab, AI Sweden office in Gothenburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  DataRätt InnoVation (DRIV) 2021-2023\n\n\nThe DataRights Innovation (DRIV) project aimed to create conditions for efficiently and accurately handling legal issues arising in research and innovation projects (R&I) within data-driven innovation...\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Federated Learning In Banking\n\n\nMoney laundering poses a significant societal threat as it enables criminals to utilize illicit funds, undermines public trust, and damages the financial system.

Vi kan träna maskininlärningsmodeller på lokalt tillgänglig (dvs. decentraliserad) data och fatta lokala beslut. Tillvägagångssättet möjliggör kombination av kunskap från flera lokala dataset, utan att faktiskt distribuera rådata mellan enheter, platser och organisationer. Till skillnad från algoritmer som tränas på ett centraliserat dataset distribuerar decentraliserat lärande modeller snarare än själva datan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI federated learning, aggregeras lokala modeller som tränats i edge-enheter vanligtvis på en central plats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkapa initialmodell\nÖverför nuvarande modell till enheter\nTräning på enheter med hjälp av lokal data\nÖverför lokala modellparametrar till aggregator\nSamla parametrar för att skapa uppdaterad modell\nSkicka den senaste modellen för vidare träning eller driftsättning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI swarm learning, används en av edge-enheterna också som en aggregator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnheter registrerar sig på nätverk\nEnheter tar emot initialmodell\nEnheter tränar modell på lokal data\nEnheter delar och sammanfogar modeller\nUpprepa steg 3-4 tills nöjd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVilka är fördelarna med edge learning?\nTraditionella centraliserade AI-applikationer har utvecklats under de senaste decennierna för att omforma hur vi lever och rör oss. Vi är bekanta med röstassistenter (t.ex. Siri, Alexa och Google Assistant). Aktiv förarassistans och automatiserade körfunktioner ökar i förekomst för att höja säkerheten och minska belastningen på förare. Samma trend syns inom hälso- och sjukvård, där assistans vid diagnostik används för att hjälpa läkare att identifiera och korrekt diagnostisera medicinska tillstånd.\nÄmnen som AI-etik, datasekretess, datasäkerhet, dataägarskap, dataöverföring, beräkning och lagringskostnader är bekymmer för företag, allmänheten och regeringar. Länder har börjat skapa policys som förstärker lokalt vs globalt lärande (t.ex. kinesiska dataskydd) eller på annat sätt begränsar den långsiktiga delade öppna användningen av data. Samtidigt är intressenter alltmer oroade över AI-snedvridning och argumenterar starkt för behovet av mer diversifierad och mindre restriktiv modellering.\nGenom att flytta lärandet till kanten kan organisationer börja samarbeta globalt samtidigt som de hanterar bekymmer kring datasäkerhet, datasekretess och hinder för dataöverföring. Samtidigt drar de nytta av att utnyttja annars outnyttjade beräkningsresurser för att lösa växande problem med bristerna i datahungrig modellering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge learning lab, AI Swedens kontor i Göteborg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjekt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  DataRätt InnoVation (DRIV) 2021-2023\n\n\nProjektet DataRätt Innovation (DRIV) har haft som målsättning att skapa förutsättningar för att på ett effektivt och korrekt sätt hantera juridiska frågor som aktualiseras i forsknings- och...\n\nLäs mer\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Federerad maskininlärning i banksektorn\n\n\nPenningtvätt utgör ett betydande samhällshot eftersom det möjliggör för brottslingar att utnyttja illegala medel, underminerar allmänhetens förtroende och skadar det finansiella systemet.

Its mission is to accelerate the use of AI in new applications for Earth observation by developing solutions in the area of Edge Learning in space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nΦ-lab(@)Sweden aims to gather industry, public sector, entrepreneurs, investors, and researchers to strengthen the European innovation activities for space applications and the space industry sector in Earth observation and AI. The lab complements other Swedish resources such as the Swedish Space Data Lab, established from collaboration between the Swedish National Space Agency, Luleå University of Technology, RISE, and AI Sweden.\nAI Sweden and Φ-lab @Sweden\nIn the near future, many space-related applications will need technology that enables AI on board. Φ-lab @Sweden intends to explore innovative ways to train AI models in space with access to hardware from several of AI Sweden’s partners, for example a development version of hardware that imitates the setup in a satellite constellation setting. Access to real hardware reduces the gap between experiments in the lab and reality in space. When researchers and innovators can experiment with different hardware, frameworks, and tools it accelerates the process from idea to impact. \nUsing AI in space means many challenging tasks can be completed faster, more accurately, and at a greater scale than traditional means. Possible use cases for AI and satellite data include identifying environmental incidents such as flooding, algal blooms, and fires, or human activities such as illegal fishing, deforestation, pollution, and more. \nWhy edge learning in space?\nToday, AI models are trained by transferring as much data as possible from sensors to a central storage and compute location. In general, the more data, the better the quality of the resulting model. However, as the number of satellites increases, the available bandwidth to transfer data will become less and less. Thus, data transfer costs are expected to rise, it will take longer to transfer enough data to Earth to train models, and the models will be less accurate if less data is transferred. \nEdge learning (also known as decentralized learning, federated learning, or swarm learning) is a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the development of AI for space applications by solving these challenges. This would save both money and resources since there is no need to send large amounts of data to the Earth.\nWhat is Φ-lab?\nAs part of the Boost Green and Digital Commercialisation priority of its Agenda 2025 strategy and building on the experience of the existing Φ-lab @ESRIN with its focus on delivering transformative innovations aimed at market adoption, ESA is creating a dynamic network of Φ-labs across ESA and Europe.

Dess uppdrag är att accelerera användningen av AI i nya tillämpningar för jordobservation genom att utveckla lösningar inom området Edge Learning i rymden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nΦ-lab(@)Sweden syftar till att samla industri, offentlig sektor, entreprenörer, investerare och forskare för att stärka de europeiska innovationsaktiviteterna för rymdtillämpningar och rymdindustrisektorn inom jordobservation och AI. Laboratoriet kompletterar andra svenska resurser som Swedish Space Data Lab, etablerat genom samarbete mellan Swedish National Space Agency, Luleå University of Technology, RISE, och AI Sweden.\nAI Sweden och Φ-lab@Sweden\nI en nära framtid kommer många rymdrelaterade tillämpningar att behöva teknik som möjliggör AI ombord. Φ-lab@Sweden avser att utforska innovativa sätt att träna AI-modeller i rymden med tillgång till hårdvara från flera av AI Swedens partners, till exempel en utvecklingsversion av hårdvara som imiterar uppställningen i en satellitkonstellation. Tillgång till verklig hårdvara minskar klyftan mellan experiment i labbet och verkligheten i rymden. När forskare och innovatörer kan experimentera med olika hårdvara, ramverk och verktyg accelererar det processen från idé till effekt.\nAtt använda AI i rymden innebär att många utmanande uppgifter kan utföras snabbare, mer exakt, och i större skala än traditionella metoder. Möjliga användningsfall för AI och satellitdata innefattar att identifiera miljöincidenter som översvämningar, algblooms, och bränder, eller mänskliga aktiviteter som olagligt fiske, avskogning, föroreningar, och mer.\nVarför edge learning i rymden?\nIdag tränas AI-modeller genom att överföra så mycket data som möjligt från sensorer till en central lagrings- och beräkningsplats. Generellt sett, ju mer data, desto bättre kvalitet på den resulterande modellen. Men, i takt med att antalet satelliter ökar, kommer den tillgängliga bandbredden för datatransfer att bli allt mindre. Således förväntas dataöverföringskostnaderna stiga, det kommer att ta längre tid att överföra tillräcklig data till Jorden för att träna modeller, och modellerna kommer att vara mindre exakta om mindre data överförs.\nEdge learning (även känt som decentralized learning, federated learning, eller swarm learning) är en teknologi som har potentialen att revolutionera utvecklingen av AI för rymdapplikationer genom att lösa dessa utmaningar. Detta skulle spara både pengar och resurser eftersom det inte finns något behov att skicka stora mängder data till jorden.\nVad är Φ-lab?\nSom en del av Boost Green and Digital Commercialisation-prioriteten i dess Agenda 2025 strategi och byggande på erfarenheten av det befintliga Φ-lab @ESRIN med dess fokus på att leverera transformativa innovationer avsedda för marknadsadoption, skapar ESA ett dynamiskt nätverk av Φ-labs över ESA och Europa.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a core element of this area. NLP algorithms (language models) learn from language data. They enable machine understanding and machine representation of natural (human) language. Using NLP, applications and tools can be used to identify patterns and provide insights hidden in large amounts of language data, too vast for humans to process. Based on patterns and insights, unstructured data can be turned into actionable information, allowing us to make data-driven and well-informed decisions. In order for Sweden to benefit from the rapid development in the applied language technology area, language models need to be trained on datasets for Swedish and minority languages spoken in Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from behind the scenes of AI\nThe AI Sweden NLU team’s aim with writing blog posts is to be as open and transparent as possible with the development process, and to invite several different perspectives on this type of model — both our own as well as those who may be more critical of this development.\nGo to Insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Data Readiness Lab\n\n\nThe Data Readiness Lab provides a collaborative environment and contributes skills, tools, frameworks and resources to increase data readiness and data maturity among actors in both the public and...\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  GPT-SW3\n\n\nAI Sweden, together with RISE and WASP WARA Media & Language, have developed a large-scale generative language model for the Nordic languages, primarily Swedish.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  GPT-SW3 validation project\n\n\nCan a large-scale Swedish generative language model reduce the threshold for using advanced language models to solve text processing tasks across a variety of sectors and use cases?\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Interdisciplinary expert pool for NLU\n\n\nThis project aims to establish and test a new form of cross-disciplinary collaboration for accelerating applied AI in the context of AI-driven language technology: The Interdisciplinary Expert Pool...\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Language Models for Swedish Authorities\n\n\nThe project develops large-scale language models for the Swedish public sector, enabling a number of applications with specific relevance to Swedish authorities.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Pilot study for federated language models in Swedish\n\n\nAI Sweden joined the National Library of Sweden and Scaleout Systems for a pilot on federatively trained language models.

Bearbetning av naturligt språk (NLP) är en kärnkomponent inom detta område. NLP-algoritmer (språkmodeller) lär sig från språkdata. De möjliggör maskinförståelse och maskinrepresentation av naturligt (mänskligt) språk. Med hjälp av NLP kan applikationer och verktyg användas för att identifiera mönster och ge insikter dolda i stora mängder språkdata, alltför omfattande för människor att bearbeta. Baserat på mönster och insikter kan ostrukturerade data omvandlas till hanterbar, nyttig information, vilket gör att vi kan fatta datadrivna och välgrundade beslut. För att Sverige ska kunna dra nytta av den snabba utvecklingen inom det tillämpade språkteknikområdet behöver språkmodeller tränas på dataset för svenska och minoritetsspråk som talas i Sverige.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsikter från bakom kulisserna av AI (blogg)\nAI Swedens NLU-team har som mål med att skriva blogginlägg att vara så öppna och transparenta som möjligt med utvecklingsprocessen och att bjuda in flera olika perspektiv på denna typ av modell - både våra egna och de som kanske är mer kritiska till denna utveckling.\nTill bloggen Insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjekt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Data Readiness Lab\n\n\nData Readiness Lab erbjuder en samarbetsmiljö och bidrar med kompetenser, verktyg, ramverk och resurser för att öka dataförberedelse och datamognad bland aktörer inom både offentlig och privat sektor...\n\nLäs mer\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  GPT-SW3\n\n\nAI Sweden, tillsammans med RISE och WASP WARA Media & Language, utvecklar en storskalig generativ språkmodell för de nordiska språken, främst svenska.\n\nLäs mer\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  GPT-SW3 valideringsprojekt\n\n\nKan en storskalig svensk generativ språkmodell sänka tröskeln för att använda avancerade språkmodeller för att lösa textbearbetningsuppgifter inom en mängd olika sektorer och användarfall?\n\nLäs mer\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Interdisciplinary expert pool for NLU\n\n\nDetta projekt syftar till att etablera och testa en ny form av tvärvetenskapligt samarbete för att accelerera tillämpad AI inom ramen för AI-driven språkteknologi: Den tvärvetenskapliga expertpoolen...\n\nLäs mer\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Pilotstudie för federativa språkmodeller på svenska\n\n\nAI Sweden anslöt sig till Kungliga biblioteket och Scaleout Systems för en pilotstudie om federativt tränade språkmodeller.

This is what AI Sweden’s energy initiative is about. The first step is an interactive simulation of the Swedish energy system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future demands for electricity in Sweden are going to be huge. Our base industries are striving to get fossil-free, even in very energy-intensive areas like steel production. At the same time, new energy-demanding production is also on its way, such as battery production. In addition, the automotive industry is moving fast towards electricity instead of petrol and diesel.\nIn this transformation, AI and data play a crucial role. By sharing data between shareholders, be it producers, consumers, or anything in between, it’s possible to build models to understand future energy needs as well as production. In a resilient electricity grid, AI will also be a key technology to plan, distribute, and balance the system at both local and national levels. \nRight now, AI Sweden together with partners is building an interactive simulation of the Swedish energy system.

The evaluation consists of a survey designed to identify the organization's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in relation to a set of best practices identified through extensive research into successful AI organizations.\n2. Analysis\nIn the second stage, analysis, the results of the assessment are analyzed and interpreted by experts from AI Sweden. This analysis involves identifying key trends, patterns, and insights from the assessment data, as well as benchmarking the organization's AI capabilities against industry best practices and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Workshop\nFinally, in the third stage, workshop, the results of the assessment and analysis are presented to a group of stakeholders from the organization in a collaborative workshop setting. The workshop provides an opportunity for participants to discuss and validate the assessment findings, share insights and perspectives, and co-create a roadmap for advancing the organization's AI capabilities. The roadmap outlines specific actions and initiatives that the organization can undertake to improve its AI maturity and advance to the next level of AI maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is AI Maturity?\nAI Maturity refers to an organization's level of expertise in using AI technologies and applications. It considers various factors such as an organization's strategy, data infrastructure, technology platforms, talent capabilities, and governance processes, among others.\nIn simpler terms, AI Maturity is about how much an organization knows about AI and how well they are using it in their operations. An organization's AI Maturity level can be evaluated along a continuum, ranging from basic use of AI to more advanced and integrated use of AI across the organization. This is illustrated below in the AI Maturity Ladder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is AI Maturity important?\nAccording to research, nine out of ten companies agree that AI represents a business opportunity for them. However, only a few companies are able to realize value using the technology. Seven out of ten companies report minimal or no impact from their AI initiatives so far. Among the 90% of companies that have made some investment in AI, fewer than two out of five report business gains from AI in the past three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSource: S. Ransbotham, S. Khodabandeh, R. Fehling, B. LaFountain, D. Kiron, “Winning With AI,” MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group, October 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this?\nOne of the reasons for this is that companies tend to treat AI as just another technology, but AI has different requirements in terms of development, operation, and maintenance, than other digital technologies, and this presents challenges for those who are entering the field of AI for the first time.\nIn addition, organizations face organizational, cultural, and knowledge challenges when they start using AI. Creating value with AI therefore requires some level of organizational transformation and new ways of working to truly accommodate the possibilities with this technology.\nWhat can be done?\nThe assessment process provides valuable insights into an organization's readiness for AI, including their data infrastructure, technology platforms, talent capabilities, and governance processes. By identifying gaps in these areas, organizations can prioritize investments in technology, talent development, and governance structures that support AI adoption and integration.\nMoreover, the assessment process encourages organizations to examine their existing culture and identify any obstacles to AI adoption, such as resistance to change, fear of automation, or a lack of data-driven decision-making. By understanding and addressing these cultural challenges, organizations can create a more supportive and collaborative environment for AI innovation and transformation.\nTime and effort\nParticipating in the AI Maturity Assessment process requires a relatively small investment of time and effort from the organization compared to the potential benefits. In terms of hours, the full assessment requires approximately 80 hours of participation, with two individuals attending meetings and around 60 people contributing to the evaluation and around 15 people to the workshop. The time commitment is designed to be manageable and flexible, allowing organizations to make progress at a pace that suits their needs and priorities. The full process, which includes activities such as evaluation and workshop sessions, typically takes around 6 weeks to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nThe AI Maturity Assessment Tool was developed by the AI consulting firm AppliedAI in collaboration with leading AI experts and practitioners. To develop the tool, Applied AI used a rigorous process that included gathering and analyzing data from over a hundred organizations on their capabilities related to AI.\nApplied AI has continued to refine the tool based on feedback from clients and the latest trends and insights in the AI field, ensuring that it remains a valuable and effective resource for organizations seeking to improve their AI capabilities and achieve their strategic objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\nWe have also created the AI Maturity Assessment training for those of you who are interested in delving deeper into all aspects of the AI Maturity Assessment process.

AI Maturity Assessment är en process utformad för att hjälpa organisationer att utvärdera sina nuvarande AI-förmågor, identifiera luckor och områden för förbättring, och utveckla en färdplan. Det är ett utmärkt sätt för organisationer att få en tydligare förståelse för de förutsättningar som krävs för att lyckas med AI och vilka steg du behöver ta för att avancera till nästa nivå. Mognadsbedömningen ingår i AI Swedens partnererbjudande.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVad hjälper bedömningsprocessen med?\nBedömningsprocessen ger en omfattande utvärdering av organisationens nuvarande AI-förmågor och identifierar specifika områden för förbättring. Detta hjälper organisationen att prioritera sina AI-initiativ och investeringar och fokusera på de områden som kommer att ha störst effekt. Dessutom ger den gemensamma workshopen i slutet av processen en möjlighet för olika delar från hela organisationen att samlas och samordna sitt AI-arbete och samarbeta för att skapa en färdplan för att förbättra organisationens AI-förmågor. Detta bidrar till att skapa samstämmighet och engagemang över hela organisationen och säkerställer att AI-initiativ prioriteras och genomförs effektivt.\nHuvudsakliga vinster av bedömningsprocessen\nAtt uppnå en gemensam förståelse för organisationens nuvarande AI-mognad, hjälper till att samordna intressenter och säkerställa att investeringar görs på rätt ställe.\nAtt uppnå bättre samordning av AI-arbetet på tvärs över funktioner och avdelningar, vilket resulterar i förbättrad effektivitet och effekt.\nAtt få konkreta förslag och en konkret färdplan för ökad AI-mognad, baserad på organisationens unika insikter och behov. Detta ger en tydlig väg framåt.\nAtt främja organisatoriskt lärande när medarbetarna exponeras för centrala områden och förutsättningar för AI-mognad, vilket resulterar i förbättrad kunskap i hela organisationen.\nMer än bara ett verktyg\nAI Maturity Assessment är en trestegsprocess som består av bedömning, analys och workshop.\n1. Bedömning\nDet första steget, bedömningen, innebär att man använder ett enkätverktyg för att genomföra en omfattande utvärdering av organisationens nuvarande AI-förmågor. Utvärderingen består av en undersökning som är utformad för att identifiera organisationens styrkor, svagheter och förbättringsområden i förhållande till de fungerande arbetssätt som identifierats genom studier av framgångsrika AI-organisationer.\n2. Analys\nI det andra steget, analysen, analyseras och tolkas resultaten av bedömningenfasen av experter från AI Sweden. Denna analys innebär att man identifiera trender, mönster och insikter i enkätsvaren, och jämföra organisationens AI-förmågor med branschen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Workshop\nSlutligen, i det tredje steget, workshopen, presenteras resultaten av bedömningen och analysen för en grupp deltagare från organisationen i en gemensam workshop. Den ger deltagarna möjlighet att diskutera och validera bedömningsresultaten, dela insikter och perspektiv och samarbeta för att skapa en färdplan för att förbättra organisationens AI-förmågor. Färdplanen innehåller specifika åtgärder och initiativ som organisationen kan vidta för att förbättra sin AI-mognad och avancera till nästa nivå av AI-mognad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVad är AI-mognad?\nAI-mognad avser en organisations nivå av förmåga i att använda AI-teknik och tillämpningar. Den tar hänsyn till olika faktorer som en organisations strategi, datainfrastruktur, teknikplattformar, medarbetare, och styrningsprocesser, bland annat.\nAI-mognad handlar om hur mycket en organisation vet om AI och hur bra de använder det i sina verksamheter. En organisations mognadsnivå kan utvärderas på en skala, som sträcker sig från grundläggande användning av AI till mer avancerad och integrerad användning av AI i hela organisationen. Detta illustreras nedan i de fem mognadsstegen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarför är AI mognad viktigt?\nEnligt forskning är nio av tio företag överens om att AI är en viktig affärsmöjlighet. Men bara ett fåtal företag kan förverkliga värdet med tekniken. Sju av tio företag rapporterar minimal eller ingen effekt av sina AI-projekt hittills. Bland de 90% av företagen som har gjort vissa investeringar i AI, rapporterar mindre än två av fem affärsframgångar från AI de senaste tre åren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKälla: S. Ransbotham, S. Khodabandeh, R. Fehling, B. LaFountain, D. Kiron, “Winning With AI,” MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group, October 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarför är det så?\nEn av anledningarna till detta är att företag tenderar att behandla AI som ytterligare en teknik i raden av många. Men AI skiljer sig när det gäller utveckling, drift och underhåll, jämfört med annan digital teknik, och detta innebär nya utmaningar för dem som för första gången går sig in i AI-världen.\nDessutom står organisationer inför organisatoriska, kulturella och kunskapsrelaterade utmaningar när de börjar använda AI. Att skapa värde med AI kräver därför en viss nivå av organisatorisk transformation och nya arbetssätt för att verkligen kunna utnyttja möjligheterna med denna teknik.\nVad kan göras?\nBedömningsprocessen ger värdefulla insikter i en organisations beredskap för AI, inklusive deras datainfrastruktur, teknikplattformar, talangförmågor och styrningsprocesser. Genom att identifiera luckor i dessa områden kan organisationer prioritera investeringar i teknik, talangutveckling och styrningsstrukturer som stödjer AI-adoption och integration.\nDessutom tvingar bedömningsprocessen organisationer att granska sin befintliga kultur och identifiera eventuella hinder för AI-adoption, som till exempel motstånd mot förändring, rädsla för automatisering eller brist på datadrivna beslut. Genom att förstå och ta itu med dessa kulturella utmaningar kan organisationer skapa en mer stödjande och samarbetsinriktad miljö för AI-innovation och transformation.\nTid och ansträngning\nAtt genomföra en mognadsmätning är en relativt liten investering i tid och ansträngning från organisationen sett i relation till de potentiella fördelarna. När det gäller timmar kräver processen ungefär 80 timmars deltagande, med två personer som deltar i planeringen, runt 60 personer som svarar på enkäten och runt 15 personer som deltar i workshopen. Arbetet är utformat för att vara hanterbar och flexibelt, vilket ger organisationer möjlighet att göra framsteg i en takt som passar deras behov och prioriteringar. Hela processen, som inkluderar aktiviteter såsom utvärdering och workshopsessioner, tar vanligtvis ungefär 6 veckor att slutföra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBakgrund\nAI Maturity Assessment-verktyget utvecklades av AI-konsultföretaget AppliedAI i samarbete med ledande AI-experter och utövare. För att utveckla verktyget använde Applied AI en rigorös process som inkluderade insamling och analys av data från över hundra organisationer om deras förmågor i relation till AI.\nApplied AI har fortsatt att förbättra verktyget baserat på feedback från kunder och de senaste trenderna och insikterna inom AI-området, för att säkerställa att det fortsätter att vara en värdefull och effektiv resurs för organisationer som strävar efter att förbättra sina AI-förmågor och uppnå sina strategiska mål.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResurser\nVi har även tagit fram en utbildning för AI-mognadsbedömning för er som är intresserade av att fördjupa er i alla aspekter av processen för AI-mognadsbedömning.

The footage for 2019 comes from two cameras that film continuously at 60 frames per second between May 1st and July 15th. The video material is in .avi files with an average length of 2 H, and a total file size of approximately 2 Tb. IR-light provides clear imagery even under complete darkness.\nIn 2020, 4 cameras were used, creating approximately 5 Tb of data. Due to the COVID lockdown, no tourists visited the island this year which led to an increased number of sea eagles and thereby increased disturbances of the common murres.\nIn order to be able to use machine learning, researchers from SLU and AI Sweden have manually annotated around 2300 still frames taken from the material with bounding boxes of approximately 18000 objects belonging to any of the three categories “Adult”, “Chick”, “Egg”. These annotations are included in the dataset download bundle.\nMore specifications can be found here\n\nUse cases to date\n1. SLU – Researching Guillemots using AI\nChallenge\nFor many years, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences has been studying the behavior of Guillemots on Stora Karlsö using CCTV. The work entailed watching thousands of hours of video footage to identify different behaviors of the birds. \nApproach\nBy developing an object detection algorithm that can identify Adults, Chicks and Eggs, SLU could automate the categorization of the different behaviors as well as identify new ones.\nThe first steps in developing this algorithm were taken in the Baltic Seabird Hackathon co-hosted by AI Sweden, SLU, and WWF in 2019. The hackathon resulted in several projects, as well as a clear intention from the researchers at SLU to focus more on AI-powered seabird research.\nOutcome\nThrough this approach, SLU could cut months of watching video footage while at the same time advancing in detecting new behaviors difficult for humans to identify.\nData scientists are currently developing a target tracking algorithm to follow individual birds frame by frame, with the goal of identifying bird individuals. Seabird researchers plan to use the target tracking of individuals to identify behaviors such as socializing, fights, and copulation.\nFurther reading\n→ Baltic Seabird Hackathon\n→ Baltic Seabird Github Repo\n→ The Baltic Seabird Project\n \n2. Zenseact – Autonomous driving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\nOvercoming difficult and time-consuming legal hurdles when training federated AI models on real-world road data.\nApproach\nThe Baltic Seabird dataset has important similarities to autonomous driving data. Firstly, the data is real-world data, not synthetic. Secondly, the challenges related to the bird dataset are similar to the ones for developing solutions for autonomous driving. Examples of this are variations in light conditions and differences in bird appearance like differences between pedestrians. But there are also two important differences between road data and bird data. There is no GDPR regulating the privacy of seabirds and there are no business secrets hidden in the dataset.\nOutcome\nThanks to the availability of the Baltic Seabird dataset, Zenseact was able to start working with their partners straight away, saving an estimated 6-12 months of organizing and waiting for legal clearances. The knowledge and learnings gained from working with the proxy data, in collaboration with others, was another gain that sped things up.\nLearnings1. Develop an understanding of what proxy data is and the benefits it can bring, for example, faster development times, easier collaboration with other organizations, and the possibility to build different solutions based on the same shared dataset. \n2. Find datasets that are representative of the challenges you have in the actual dataset your models are going to use. Without these similarities between the real data and the proxy data, it will be hard to draw any generalized conclusions from the work with the proxy data.\n3. Find organizations to collaborate with.

Dessa fåglar tillbringar största delen av sin tid till havs, men från maj till juli varje år kommer de till Stora Karlsö för att lägga sina ägg på kalkstensklipporna.\nCCTV-kamerasystemet installerades 2019. Inspelningarna för 2019 kommer från två kameror som filmar kontinuerligt med 60 bilder per sekund mellan 1 maj och 15 juli. Videomaterialet finns i .avi-filer med en genomsnittlig längd på 2 timmar och en total filstorlek på ungefär 2 TB. IR-ljus ger tydliga bilder även i totalt mörker.\nÅr 2020 användes 4 kameror, vilket genererade cirka 5 TB data. På grund av COVID-lockdown besökte inga turister ön detta år, vilket ledde till ett ökat antal havsörnar och därmed ökade störningar för lunnefåglarna.\nFör att kunna använda maskininlärning har forskare från SLU och AI Sweden manuellt annoterat cirka 2300 stillbilder tagna från materialet med inramningar av ungefär 18000 objekt som tillhör någon av de tre kategorierna \"Adult\", \"Chick\", \"Egg\".

SLU – Forskning om lunnefåglar med hjälp av AI\nChallenge\nI många år har SLU studerat beteendet hos lunnefåglar på Stora Karlsö med hjälp av CCTV. Arbetet innebar att titta på tusentals timmar av videoinspelningar för att identifiera olika beteenden hos fåglarna.\nTillvägagångssätt\nGenom att utveckla en objektdetekteringsalgoritm som kan identifiera Adults, Chicks and Eggs, kunde SLU automatisera kategoriseringen av de olika beteendena samt identifiera nya.\nDe första stegen i utvecklingen av denna algoritm togs i Baltic Seabrid Hackaton som var samordnad av AI Sweden, SLU, och WWF 2019. Hackathonet resulterade i flera projekt, samt en tydlig avsikt från forskarna vid SLU att fokusera mer på AI-driven sjöfågelforskning.\nResultat\nGenom denna metod kunde SLU spara månader av att titta på videoinspelningar samtidigt som de gick framåt i att upptäcka nya beteenden som är svåra för människor att identifiera.\nDatavetare utvecklar för närvarande en målspårningsalgoritm för att följa individuella fåglar bildruta för bildruta, med målet att identifiera individuella fåglar. Sjöfågelforskare planerar att använda målspårningen av individer för att identifiera beteenden såsom socialisering, slagsmål, och parning.\nVidare läsning\n→ Baltic Seabird Hackathon\n→ Baltic Seabird Github Repo\n→ The Baltic Seabird Project\n \n \n2. Zenseact – Autonomous driving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtmaning\nAtt övervinna svåra och tidskrävande juridiska hinder när man tränar federerade AI-modeller på verklig vägdata.\nTillvägagångssätt\nBaltic Seabird-datasetet har viktiga likheter med data från autonom körning. För det första är datan verklig data, inte syntetisk. För det andra liknar utmaningarna relaterade till fågeldatasetet de som uppstår när man utvecklar lösningar för autonom körning. Exempel på detta är variationer i ljusförhållanden och skillnader i fåglarnas utseende, liknande skillnader mellan fotgängare. Men det finns också två viktiga skillnader mellan vägdata och fågeldata. Det finns ingen GDPR som reglerar sekretess för sjöfåglar, och det finns inga affärshemligheter gömda i datasetet.\nResultat\nTack vare tillgängligheten av Baltic Seabird-datasetet kunde Zenseact börja samarbeta med sina partners direkt och spara uppskattningsvis 6-12 månader av organisering och väntan på juridiska tillstånd. Kunskapen och erfarenheterna som samlades in genom att arbeta med proxydata i samarbete med andra var en annan fördel som påskyndade processen.\nLärdomar1. Utveckla en förståelse för vad proxydata är och fördelarna det kan medföra, till exempel snabbare utvecklingstider, enklare samarbete med andra organisationer och möjligheten att bygga olika lösningar baserade på samma delade dataset.\n2. Hitta dataset som är representativa för de utmaningar du har i det faktiska dataset som dina modeller kommer att använda. Utan dessa likheter mellan riktig data och proxydata kommer det vara svårt att dra generella slutsatser från arbetet med proxydata.\n3. Hitta organisationer att samarbeta med.

The data is composed of images from different highways in Sweden, more specifically around Gothenburg. The dataset has been acquired during different seasons which has made it possible to capture different weather conditions. The aim of the dataset is to be used for object detection and classification, lane detection and classification, and free-space detection.\nTo create this dataset, an initial study of the sensor configuration was needed. Then, the sensors were placed on a test truck and a plan for data collection was constructed. The data was continuously acquired during different seasons and then processed and sent for annotation. The annotation was performed by an external supplier Annotell. The annotations were done manually to get more accurate results.\nThe Volvo Highway Dataset contains 28778 labeled images. The annotations include road objects, lane markings, road edges, and free space. These annotations are divided into 7 classes of object vehicles, 3 classes of lane markers, and 4 classes of road edges. In addition, the dataset contains polygons for the object that can be used for semantic segmentation and object localization.\nMore specifications can be found here\n \nUse cases to date\n1.

SMIRK, an ML-based pedestrian automatic emergency braking system\nChallenge\nThe dataset has been used in the development of the experimental pedestrian automatic emergency braking system SMIRK led by RISE. ML components are increasingly being integrated into cyber-physical systems such as cars. Unfortunately, there are few completely open ML-based demonstrator systems for the research community to study. While systems such as OpenPilot and Baidu Apollo are available under open-source software licenses, their underlying ML models and their datasets are not available for study. As ML-based systems interweave data and source code, this is a research impediment.\nApproach\nThe dataset synthesizes scenarios (pedestrians and geometric shapes) moving towards and away from a mono camera. These scenarios were used to train models for object detection/recognition and anomaly detection in the SMIRK system. The system is implemented for the simulator ESI Pro-SiVIC with core components including a radar sensor, a mono camera, a YOLOv5 model, and an ML-based anomaly detector.\nOutcome\nThe team successfully developed the SMIRK system and its complete development documentation is available on GitHub under a GPL license. As a fully transparent driver-assistance system, SMIRK can support future research on trustworthy AI systems, such as verification and validation, requirements engineering, and AI testing.\nFurther reading\n→ SMIRK GitHub repository\n→ Original Software Publication (OSP) has been accepted by Elsevier Software Impacts\n2. Safety assurance of the ML component in SMIRK\nChallenge\nHow to best integrate ML components in safety-critical systems is an open challenge in both research and practice. ML-based computer vision is considered a key enabler for cyber-physical systems that rely on environmental perception. However, the step from demonstrating impressive results on computer vision benchmarks to deploying systems that rely on ML for safety-critical functionalities is substantial. An ML model can be considered an unreliable function that sometimes will fail to generalize new input to its learned representations. How should safety assurance for ML-based components be approached?\nApproach\nIt was decided to develop the safety case in accordance with the emerging standard ISO 21448 SOTIF and the methodology Assurance of Machine Learning for use in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS).\nOutcome\nBased on a highly restricted operational design domain for SMIRK, we present a complete safety case for its ML component, i.e., a structured safety argumentation supported by evidence. A safety argumentation using goal structuring notation is available in the SMIRK GitHub repository. Together with 34 individual artifacts, prescribed by AMLAS, this constitutes proof that SMIRK’s ML component has achieved its safety goals.\nFurther reading\n→ SMIRK GitHub repository\n→ arXiv preprint of the paper describing the safety case \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\nThe dataset is available for all AI Sweden partners.

ML-komponenter integreras allt mer i cyber-fysiska system som bilar. Tyvärr finns det få helt öppna ML-baserade demonstrations system för forskningssamhället att studera. Även om system som OpenPilot och Baidu Apollo finns tillgängliga under open-source mjukvarulicenser, är deras underliggande ML-modeller och deras [dataset](https://www.ai.se/en/data-factory/datasets) inte tillgängliga för studier. Eftersom ML-baserade system sammanflätar data och källkod är detta ett forskningshinder.\nTillvägagångssätt\nDatasetet syntetiserar scenarier (fotgängare och geometriska former) som rör sig mot och bort från en mono-kamera. Dessa scenarier användes för att träna modeller för objektigenkänning/-detektering och anomalidetektering i SMIRK-systemet.

Säkerhetsgaranti för ML-komponenten i SMIRK\nUtmaning\nHur man bäst integrerar ML-komponenter i säkerhetskritiska system är en öppen utmaning inom både forskning och praktik. ML-baserad datorseende anses vara en nyckelaktiverare för cyber-fysiska system som förlitar sig på miljöuppfattning. Men steget från att visa imponerande resultat på datorseende-benchmarks till att distribuera system som förlitar sig på ML för säkerhetskritiska funktionaliteter är betydande. En ML-modell kan betraktas som en opålitlig funktion som ibland kommer att misslyckas med att generalisera ny input till dess inlärda representationer. Hur bör säkerhetsgaranti för ML-baserade komponenter närmas?\nTillvägagångssätt\nDet beslutades att utveckla säkerhetsfallet i enlighet med den framväxande standarden ISO 21448 SOTIF och metoden Assurance of Machine Learning for use in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS).\nResultat\nBaserat på ett starkt begränsat operationellt designområde för SMIRK, presenterar vi ett komplett säkerhetsfall för dess ML-komponent, dvs. en strukturerad säkerhetsargumentation stödd av bevis. En säkerhetsargumentation med hjälp av målstrukturering notation finns tillgänglig i [SMIRK GitHub-repository](https://github.com/RI-SE/smirk/).

The respective Programs have their own websites and newsletter etc., but they are not legal entities as such. Lindholmen Science Park is the controller for all processing of your personal data conducted by the respective Programs.\nAI Sweden is one of Lindholmen Science Park’s Programs and hence, the main privacy policy for Lindholmen Science Park is applicable also for the processing within the program AI Sweden. AI Sweden has initiated an initiative in relation to Natural Language Understanding. In order to provide you specific information about \nour processing of your personal data in relation to AI Sweden’s Strategic Initiative Natural Language Understanding (the “NLU initiative”) we have created a specific Privacy policy to inform you about the processing of personal data in relation to the NLU initiative. We will therefore link you to the main Privacy policy for Lindholmen Science Park when the general information is applicable. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us through the contact information found below. \nAI Sweden has established the NLU initiative with the goal to accelerate the development and use of applied language technologies in Sweden—in both the private and public sectors. Financed by the Swedish government through Vinnova, the NLU initiative focuses specifically on building very large-scale language models for the Swedish language. Such models require intensive amounts of data, compute and competence, and are thus greatly facilitated by collaborative efforts. The NLU initiative promotes and facilitates such efforts in Sweden and in the Nordic region. Moreover, the Initiative connects models, results, methods, data, and networks across a collaborative project portfolio, initiates national and international research collaborations, attracts and educates talent, and acts as an international thought leader in the field of Natural Language Understanding. \nThis part of the Privacy Policy includes the following information: \nHow we process personal data when you as a user access the NLU initiative’s resources such as models. \nHow we process personal data for community facilitating purposes. \nHow we process personal data potentially present in a training dataset.\nWe may update this Privacy Policy and the respective sections listed above from time to time. If you have any questions or concerns about our processing of your personal data, do not hesitate to contact us. Please see our contact details below. \nYour rights \nBelow you can read about the rights you have in relation to our processing of your personal data. To exercise your rights, you are welcome to contact us in accordance with our contact information below. \nRight to withdraw your consent and object to our processing \nFor processing activities that we base on the legal basis, consent, you have the right to, at any time, withdraw your consent. It is important to note that, if you withdraw your consent, it only applies to processing that has already taken place. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for marketing purposes. You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data that is based on the legal basis that the processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest. \nRight to access \nYou have the right to obtain a confirmation from us as to whether or not we process your personal data. If we process your personal data, you have the right to receive information about our processing of your personal data. You also have the right to request a copy of the personal data we process about you. \nRight to rectification \nYou have the right to have incorrect personal data corrected and to have incomplete information completed by providing us with the correct information. \nRight to erasure (right to be forgotten) and limitation of our processing You have the right to request that we erase your personal data (for example, if the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose of the processing). You may also request that we restrict certain processing of your personal data (for example if you object to the accuracy of the data). \nRight to data portability \nIf you have given your consent to our processing of your personal data or if the legal basis for our processing is to fulfill an agreement with you, then you have the right to obtain the personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit such personal data to another controller or that we assist you in transmitting the data to another controller when this is technically feasible. \nRight to complain\nYou have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority concerning our processing of your personal data. The supervisory authority in Sweden is (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten - IMY). See contact information to IMY below. \nOur contact information \nIf you want to contact us with regards to our processing of your personal data, or if you want to exercise your rights in relation to our processing of your personal data, you are welcome to contact us through the contact details below. \nCONTROLLER \nName: Lindholmen Science Park AB\nCompany organization number: 556568-6366\nPostal address: Lindholmspiren 3-5, Box 8077, SE-402 78 Gothenburg\nE-mail address: privacy@lindholmen.se\nTelephone number: +46 (0)70-820 29 69 \nSUPERVISORY AUTHORITY \nName: Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten, IMY\nPostal address: Box 8114, 104 20 Stockholm, Sweden\nE-mail address: imy@imy.se\nTelephone number: +46 (0)08-657 61 00\n1. How we process personal data when you as a user access the NLU initiative’s resources such as models. \nAs a result of that you and/or your employer or principal request access to any of the NLU resources, we will process your personal data. We will process your personal data to be able to comply with your request and to provide the services (the “NLU services”). The NLU services are provided in three ways, one being an API solution, the second being a web interface that interacts with the API, and the third is access to models through download. \nWhat personal data do we process? \nFacilitation and networking Section \nWe process your first and last name, email address, title/professional position and company affiliation if applicable, credentials needed for you to access the NLU services such as authentication tokens or usernames and passwords, username (user ID), any profile or biographical information you choose to provide and other required contact details, other relevant credentials for third party solutions, information about when you apply for access, when you are granted access, intended use case, your voluntary given user experience and results. \nUse Section \nWe also process personal data about you in relation to your use of the NLU services: \na. When you use one of our API-/Web Interface-solutions we will process information about your activities such as logs of your use, your IP-address, the content you send to the API and statistical information of your activities. \nb. When you through download and self hosting get access to one of our models we will process information about your user experience, use case and model performance, if you choose to share such information with us. \nThe two sections above are together called (“User Details”). \nWe may, when legally required, collect and process information about your nationality to comply with export control regulations to which we are subject. \nWhat are the purposes of our processing of your personal data and what legal basis do we base such processing on? \nWe process your User Details for the following purposes: \nProviding the NLU services;\nCollaborative knowledge building; \nImproving our services; \nAssociated communication by email or other communication channels;\nProviding support to the User; \nResolve disputes and enforce our policies, licenses, and agreements. \nWe process your User Details based upon that the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest to be able to provide the NLU services and to fulfill our contractual rights and obligations. \nIf we are legally required to collect and process information about your nationality, such processing is based on the legal basis of complying with regulations to which we are subject, such as export control. \nFrom where do we collect your personal data? \nWe receive personal data directly from you in connection with your request to use the NLU services and when you use the NLU services. We may also collect personal data from your employer or principal or from our processors for the NLU services. \nWho do we share your personal data with? \nWe share your personal data with third parties that process personal data on our behalf, so-called processors. These processors are, e.g., suppliers of support and maintenance. \nWe may also transfer personal data to third parties acting as independent controllers or joint controllers with Lindholmen Science Park if such transfer is required by applicable law, or if we have another legal ground for such transfers. You can find specific information about how AI Sweden collaborates with joint controllers on AI Sweden’s website here. \nFor how long period of time is your personal data stored? \nPersonal data processed for the purpose of providing the NLU services will be processed for the duration of use for the NLU service and as long as we have any contractual rights and obligations towards you or your employer or principal. When you are no longer a user of the NLU services, we will save your information for six (6) months. After that, we will delete your personal data. \nOur processing of your nationality for the purpose of complying with relevant export control regulations that we are required will be processed for the duration of your use of the NLU services and six (6) months after. This retention period may be prolonged if legally required.\nTransfer of personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA \nWe strive to only process personal data within the EU/EEA. When we transfer your personal data to third parties acting as our processors these processors may transfer data outside the EU/EEA on our behalf. In cases where our processors are transferring or processing personal data outside the EU/EEA, such processing is based either on a decision from the European Commission establishing that the country in question ensures an adequate level of protection or appropriate safeguards that ensure that your rights are protected such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission and supplementary security measures to such standard contractual clauses when necessary. \n2. How we process personal data for community facilitating purposes. \nWe process your personal data to build and facilitate a community for sharing and building knowledge and networking connected to NLU. \nInformation about how we process your personal data in relation to marketing and invitations can be found at Lindholmen Science Park’s main Privacy policy here. \nInformation about how we process your personal data in relation to registration and participation in events can be found at Lindholmen Science Park’s main Privacy policy here. \n3. How we process personal data potentially present in a training dataset. \nWe process your personal data when your personal data is included in a dataset that is used by the NLU initiative. \nTo clarify, we will not collect nor process datasets for the specific purpose of collecting personal data and do not in any way attempt to identify the individuals that may be identifiable in a dataset. The personal information potentially present in the datasets is of no interest to the purpose of the Strategic Initiative Natural Language Understanding. \nWhat personal data may be processed in a dataset in the NLU initiative? The personal data processed will be in text format and may include personal information that is publicly accessible online. \nWhat are the purposes of our processing of your personal data and what legal basis do we base such processing on?\nThe processing of your personal data is based upon the legal basis that the processing is necessary for purposes of our legitimate interest to democratize the knowledge about, development of, and access to language models in Swedish and, as part of that, train very large Swedish and Nordic Language models. Training these types of models is a part of building the foundation for Swedish Language Technology to ensure a high level of citizen welfare and economic competitiveness in Sweden as well as contributing to state-of-the-art research. The personal data that is processed are processed in a non-structured way and the NLU initiative has no interest in the personal information potentially present in the datasets. \nFrom where do we collect your personal data? \nThe datasets will be collected from open sources on the internet by the NLU initiative. \nWho do we share your personal data with? \nWe will not share datasets (including identifiable markers for personal information) to external parties other than collaborative parties within the NLU initiative. \nWe will also transfer personal data to third parties acting as our processors, e.g., suppliers of support and maintenance. \nFor how long period of time is your personal data stored? \nWe need to be able to validate our research and hence we need to keep the datasets we use for a longer period of time. For reasons of research ethics, transparency, and accountability the NLU-team will hence manage the data sources as long as this is necessary based on our purpose. \nTransfer of personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA \nWe strive to only process personal data within the EU/EEA. When we transfer your personal data to third parties acting as our processors these processors may transfer data outside the EU/EEA on our behalf. In cases where our processors are transferring or processing personal data outside the EU/EEA, such processing is based either on a decision from the European Commission establishing that the country in question ensures an adequate level of protection or appropriate safeguards that ensure that your rights are protected such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission and supplementary security measures to such standard contractual clauses when necessary."}

It requires bold leadership, scaled collaboration across sectors, and dedicated government investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Svensson\nManaging Director - AI Sweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many other countries, Sweden faces growing grand challenges such as increasing energy demand, demographics, crime, and national security. The consequences of the demographics alone turn the usage of AI and modern technology into a necessity, as the welfare sector otherwise would need 100% of the newly graduated workforce at the same time as there are limits to tax raises. Today’s solutions are simply not the solutions that will build the future of society. \nIn the private sector, many companies are seeing rapidly increasing international competition and signs of coming dramatic disruption, often driven by new possibilities enabled by AI. To preserve and strengthen its competitiveness, Sweden should make sure its private sector and not least, large exporting corporations increase their knowledge and investments in AI. \nCountries that early on have invested heavily in AI research and talent through research-focused strategies (e.g Canada) now face a crucial choice to invest beyond research and experimentation to enable adoption or lag behind. While others have to change their strategies, Sweden on the other hand has an opportunity to act fast and implement an adoption-focused strategy from the beginning. A bold strategy focused on generating value and adoption across industry and society would be a driver for collaboration, collective learning, and talent attraction. However, to succeed with such a strategy and compensate for the lack of early investments in AI, Sweden needs to collaborate with leading nations to access expertise and talent. \nSweden should act now and substantially invest in developing capabilities throughout sectors, throughout society. This Strategy therefore focuses on AI being adopted and generating sustainable value in the private and public sector, as well as across fields of research. \nFurther, the Strategy is inspired by the strategies of Canada, USA, UK, Germany, and Singapore. Several representatives for these countries have also been involved in the reference groups giving input and feedback. \nThis Strategy has been developed by the management of AI Sweden, the national center for applied AI with the mission to Accelerate the use of AI for the benefit of our society, our competitiveness, and for everyone living in Sweden, with feedback and input from two reference groups (to be disclosed when work completed). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis AI Strategy for Sweden consists of 5 parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVision\n\n\n\n\nFundamental standpoints & perspectives\n\n\n\n\nKey principles - The core strategy\n\n\n\n\nHigh-level Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nResponsible use of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 1\nVision - a desired future state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a desired future state Sweden should constitute a robust and highly attractive Swedish AI ecosystem enabling organizations to use AI for solving key societal and business challenges while contributing to a positive impact on our planet and people globally.\nWe believe that such an ecosystem will have the ambition and capabilities to substantially contribute to a great democratic society with a high quality of life, and societal and business solutions valuable to many other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 2\nFundamental standpoints and perspectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping this strategy, we have identified the following five fundamental standpoints and perspectives, which we believe must be recognized by any decision-maker or organization for whom this strategy is relevant. \nThese standpoints and perspectives also directly guide the Key principles in part three below. We have high confidence in the relevance and importance of these standpoints and perspectives but are aware that they may not represent a complete and deep analysis of the current view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe international private sector constantly expands its lead\n\n\n\n2\nThe extreme pace of development must be recognized and acted upon \n\n\n\n3\nAI technology is generally widely available\n\n\n\n4\nAdoption starts with leadership and deep knowledge throughout organizations\n\n\n\n5\nAI has unique properties requiring collaboration in ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - The international private sector constantly expands its lead\n\n\n\nThe last years have clearly shown that the use of AI at scale and profound breakthroughs happen in the private sector, not least in the USA. Companies with the resources, leadership, and talent lead the way and constantly increase their lead through a positive reinforcement loop of attracting more talent, generating more value, increasing investments, attracting more talent, and so on. \nThe trend is clear, organizations and companies understand AI the best and increase their investments the most. Consequently, the gap between the best and laggards continues to widen. As the value and potency of AI typically scale exponentially, the importance of not falling behind cannot be emphasized enough. \nTo stay relevant, we believe that Sweden should engage and learn from the best on all levels.\nReference: Hai AI Index report 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n2 - The extreme pace of development must be recognized and acted upon \n\n\n\nThe pace at which AI is being developed is unprecedented, lately demonstrated by generative AI. The pace is challenging companies and organizations in all sectors to expand their capabilities fast enough and for academic research on AI methodologies and technology to stay relevant. \nTo stay adaptive and maximize a nation's or a national ecosystem’s competitiveness new ways of working are necessary. This means that new incentives, new funding processes, and new ways of collaborating should be identified and deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - AI technology is generally widely available\n\n\n\nMature and powerful AI technologies are already today freely available or accessible as ready-to-be-used services, and the bottleneck for sustainable and valuable adoption is often leadership and competence to adopt. An important factor to successful adoption is also to look at transformational challenges both on individual, organizational, and societal levels. \nHence, a strategy aiming at accelerating the use of AI should prioritize investments driving adoption, economic growth, and benefits, such as initiatives driving collaboration, enabling access to existing technology, ensuring that the ecosystem includes service providers, building national computational infrastructure, and attracting talent at scale. \nAs AI technology is widely available and will lead to scaled adoption, research on the economic potential, societal value, consequences and safety of AI systems become increasingly important. In parallel, there is also the untapped potential of accelerating research in various fields (medicine, biology, materials, etc) by the involvement of AI expertise and the use of modern tools and technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 - Adoption starts with leadership and deep knowledge throughout organizations\n\n\n\nStrong and knowledgeable leadership deeply understanding the potential value of AI, setting direction, and making concrete investments is critical for any nation, organization, or company that wants to broadly benefit from the opportunities of AI. Lack of leadership increases the risks of AI being used in ways not aligned with responsible AI principles, not beneficial for society, or misaligned with other objectives.  \nFurther, to succeed the actual knowledge level and competence throughout companies, organizations, and government will determine how well and sustainably AI solutions will be built and deployed. \nAn AI strategy for Sweden should therefore immediately and forcefully strive to increase knowledge level and competence among both leaders and the overall workforce throughout society. \n\n\n\n\n\n5 - AI has unique properties requiring collaboration in ecosystems\n\n\n\nUnlike many technologies, the deployment and adoption of AI technology and solutions come with value creation and synergies across all sectors of society. Moreover, very few organizations/companies, or even nations, can build enough capability and competence themselves. Extensive collaboration is therefore essential and nations should recognize the need to invest in the building of AI ecosystems by facilitating and incentivizing collaboration. \nFor Sweden especially, with the high decentralization of the Swedish public sector (e.g. 21 regions, 290 municipalities, 350+ government agencies), collaboration becomes even more important as very few organizations individually are capable of building and managing necessary infrastructure, data, and solutions. Significant activities and investments compensation for decentralization must be put in place on all levels from government and downwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext\nPrevious\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The research community, industry, and Government play important, interconnected roles to enable the development and deployment of AI solutions. It is critical for Singapore to enhance partnerships across these stakeholders to strengthen our collective capabilities and drive our overall national AI effort.”\nFrom: Singapore's AI Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“With new opportunities, risks, and threats to prosperity and security at stake, the promise and peril associated with this foundational technology are too vast for any single actor to manage alone. As a result, cooperation is inherently needed to equally mitigate international security risks, as well as to capitalize on the technology’s potential to transform enterprise functions, mission support, and operations.”\nFrom: An Artificial Intelligence Strategy for NATO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore reading and background\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant strengths and weaknesses of Sweden\n\nWhen developing an AI strategy, Sweden has some comparative advantages and disadvantages worth considering. \nRelative to its size, Sweden has both many diverse exporting enterprises as well as a rich startup community, which should mean that many companies are exposed to competitive markets and need to be early adopters.\nSweden also ranks high on innovation and potential benefits of AI, has internationally recognized quality management, and has a history of successfully managing change both within organizations and for society at large. The culture of early delegation with a lack of management involvement can on the other side lead to slow AI adoption and poor prioritization.\nThe public sector is well organized and holds exceptionally valuable data, but is also highly decentralized with many small organizations facing difficulties in establishing relevant leadership, attracting relevant competence and investing according to the opportunities. Several other sectors are also lagging for similar reasons, not least the vast number of SMEs:s.\nThe education system is divided between humanities and science. The transformation initiated by AI implies the need for more workers skilled in several fields. Sweden has few programs overlapping disciplines and there are few indications that this will change during the coming years.\nLike many other EU nations, Sweden has focused on regulations rather than the combination of implementation and regulation. The latter is more common in North America and Asia which means these continents also learn about disadvantages and the need for relevant regulations.\n\n\n\nGlobal ranking\n\nAccording to the Global AI Index Sweden ranks as number 17 in total, and as follows in the seven categories:\nTalent - 15 \nInfrastructure - 21 \nOperating Environment - 2\nResearch - 13\nDevelopment - 17\nGovernment Strategy - 44\nCommercial - 16  \nWhat clearly stands out is the lack of Government Strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 3\nKey principles - the core strategy & mindset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Principles constitute the core of this strategy and should serve as a mindset that permeates, guides, and aligns actions, investments, and initiatives associated with this strategy. \nIf all relevant actions or investments were based and mapped against these principles we believe Sweden would quickly see positive effects and over time maximize the long-term impact throughout the ecosystem. \nAs an example, an AI commission at the government level should collaborate with the best international peers, be structured across ministries, attract some of the best talent for the assignment, and catalyze investments and actions according to all Key principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngage and learn from the best nations and international organizations\nGiven the pace of development internationally and that many of the objectives are best managed on an international level, Sweden should actively seek partnerships with like-minded countries, companies, research institutes, non-profit organizations, think tanks, and individuals, especially where there is a ground for mutual learning and development. \nInternational collaboration should preferably be focused and result in a high density of interactions with selected ecosystems. \nIn parallel, Sweden must make it easier for international talent to stay, study, work, live, and remain in Sweden, as well as incentivize and enable the private and public sectors to recruit talent internationally.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantially increase the knowledge level and competence everywhere in the ecosystem \nA higher level of knowledge leads to better insights and understanding of what investments, actions, and competence are needed, and as a key principle leaders throughout society should strive to increase the knowledge level and add competence (knowledgeable talent and workforce) in their respective organization, whether that is within government, private companies, public organizations, ministries, government agencies or academia. \nFurther, all initiatives quickly increasing the overall competence in the ecosystem should be incentivized and prioritized. More competence is necessary at all levels of education and in all professional roles relevant to AI adoption (not least leaders, change makers, legal experts, AI practitioners, and domain experts). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in strategic resources that can be shared with many \nIncentives and funding for the development of strategic and important resources for sovereignty, independence, and scaled adoption (such as national computational infrastructure, Swedish large language models, methods for how to build decentralized systems, AI adoption tools for leaders, etc) should be built in broad collaborations and made available as widely as possible. \nAI Sweden (among others) has demonstrated that the willingness among international and Swedish companies and organizations to jointly invest in knowledge and strategic resources enabling the adoption of AI is significant. When structured on a truly collaborative basis and with strong sharing mechanisms (such as My AI), the return on investment can be significant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the best to perform even better and incentivize them to share generously \nBy identifying and recognizing forerunners, i.e. companies and organizations investing and demonstrating real value by AI, Sweden would quickly reinforce a pay-it-forward culture encouraging responsibility, change, investments, and collaboration. \nAmbitious forerunners also exist in both private and public sectors in Sweden. These companies and organizations should be enabled and incentivized to move even faster and generate more value given that they share generously with others in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild an ecosystem and scale collaboration across sectors\nTo foster and drive collaboration, Sweden should scale initiatives that build the ecosystem and facilitate collaboration. This should include a strong ambition to compensate for the high decentralization of the public sector through investments in collaboration and sharing, both between several public organizations and between public and private organizations. \nFacilitation of collaboration should include incentives for consortiums to build joint advanced solutions, structures, and regulations enabling access to real-world data and in general build on mechanisms that allow fast pace and adaptivity. \n \nSweden should also consider investing in one or two “moonshots”, e.g. large-scale initiatives where many actors come together to solve a grand challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nOECD overview of national AI strategies (from 2021)\nUSA National AI R&D Strategy\nUSA National Security Strategy on AI \nUSA  NATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN, 2023 UPDATE \nStrengthening and Democratization the U.S. AI Innovation System\nPan-Canadian AI Strategy\nUK National AI Strategy\nSingapore National AI Strategy\nJapan Revised AI Strategy\nNorway National Strategy AI\nDenmark National Strategy for AI\nAustralia Strategy for Generative AI\nNATO AI Strategy\nEU thoughts on AI Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 4\nHigh-level Roadmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRealizing that AI is necessary to solve today's societal challenges, and given the suggested Key principles, what action would be necessary to best and in the shortest possible time contribute to the Vision, i.e. an ecosystem with ambition and capabilities to substantially contribute to a great democratic society with a high quality of life, and societal and business solutions valuable to Sweden and other countries? \nEarly 2024 the Swedish AI ecosystem is well prepared and Sweden stands a good chance to benefit from AI. The Swedish private sector is highly diverse, has a strong track record of being innovative, and includes several significant frontrunners. The interest in AI and the collaborative spirit in the public sector are quickly growing and good examples of valuable solutions are being deployed. The combination of WASP’s investment in fundamental research and talent, and AI Sweden's dedicated effort to driving adoption across sectors, is from what we can see a unique strength that few countries can match. \nThis High-level Roadmap therefore focuses on the critical aspects that still are missing and that we believe would have a high impact. These center around national, i.e. government initiated, leadership, investments, and other efforts to scale the benefits of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1 - Actions with high impact\nAmong the knowledgeable leaders in academia and the private and public sectors, we see a clear consensus that Sweden needs to act urgently to ensure its competitiveness and continuous ability to develop its welfare. A number of highly prioritized actions should be put in place immediately, below the most critical. Below are the most urgent, preferably acted upon during 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn process\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National AI commission - Government\n\nThe Swedish government has announced an AI commission that is tasked to analyze and come up with concrete proposals on how AI can promote Sweden as a leading research nation, advanced industrial nation and ambitious welfare nation.\nThis is an excellent step that should lead to concrete deliverables that the government acts upon starting 2024 and further alignment among key stakeholders in the Swedish AI ecosystem. \nPress release \nDirective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrgent\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment competence, leadership and direction - Government\n\nThe government should show clear direction and leadership. Given the highly decentralized Swedish public sector and the large number of leaders and decision-makers on various levels, government leadership and direction become even more important.  \nGovernment leadership and direction should for instance include Clearly appointing a minister responsible for AI, preferably with horizontal responsibilities across ministries\nIdentify and communicate the potential in the private and public sector\nSet a strategy toward realizing such potential \nEstablish active international collaboration with leading nations and participation in relevant international initiatives and decision-making (not least in the European Union)\nClearly separate AI from the broadly used term digitalization\nThe Government should also actively increase competence and use of AI throughout the government office (“Regeringskansliet”). Ideally, each ministry would appoint two to three knowledgeable and responsible for AI-related questions, as well as having access to coordinating and strategic expertise available for government and government offices.\n\n\n\nDedicated investments on AI - Government\n\nAI is likely the strongest driving force behind the mentioned transformation of society and key leaders in Sweden, such as business leaders, policy-makers, and leaders within the government should immediately start discussing AI according to its magnitude and investing to realize the identified potential. \nDedicated investments are necessary to demonstrate leadership, substantially increase the knowledge level, build strategic resources build an active ecosystem, and scale collaboration across sectors. The investments should be ramped up towards an ambitious level related to the identified potential.\nAnd, the potential is very high. According to DIGG, in the public sector alone and based on available technology by 2019 (i.e. long before generative AI) the estimated potential is SEK 140 billion per year, or more than SEK 10 billion in missed opportunity for every month that passes without action. \nGovernment investments will be matched by minimum corresponding investments in both the private and public sectors, and lead to ripple effects and clearly higher economic value throughout the ecosystem. One example is this report from Teknikföretagen. \nAccording to An AI Strategy for Sweden, government investments in AI should include funding programs that lead to a substantial increase in the knowledge level in the ecosystem, develop strategic resources that are shared with many, enable frontrunners to move faster and share generously, scales the building of the AI ecosystem and collaboration across sectors, and incentivizes international collaboration with leading nations and organizations.\nWe recommend that the overall investments in AI include significant investments through Vinnova, where the collaborative structures, ecosystems, and knowledge already are in place. \nFor reference, one of the most natural countries for Sweden to collaborate with is Canada where between 2022 and 2023, $2.57 billion was invested in AI research in the country, as total AI investment reached $8.64 billion. See more here. \nFurther on the top 10 Countries Leading in AI Research and technology in 2023, see here.\n\n\n\nIncrease investments in innovation in general - Government & Ministry of Climate and Enterprise\n\nWith the pace of technological development and demonstrated value and implications, we can conclude that we are in the early phase of significantly transformative times. Perhaps the most transformative times in history. In such times, government general investments driving innovation, applied research and change are more important than ever. \nGeneral investments in innovation and applied research advance development in many sectors and as one effect of many, lead to better generation, higher maturity, and availability of data and data management.\nSweden should make sure it is on par with nations investing the most related to its GDP. \nAgain we recommend building on existing structures, and within the total investments in innovation in general, include significantly increased investments through Vinnova.\n\n\n\nUpskilling and reskilling - Ministry of Education and Research\n\nBroad programs should be put in place to add AI skills to all educational fields and levels, as well as programs incentivizing both private and public sectors to invest in up- and reskilling of the existing workforce. This is especially important for non-STEM education. \nIntroducing new courses in existing curriculums in Universities and University Colleges has proven to take a long time and the Ministry of Education and Research should act to both incentivize and force change, as well as establish new ways for the educational system to bring AI to their students.\n\n\n\nUpskilling and reskilling - Universities and University Colleges\n\nThe transformation of society means that a large share of the existing workforce needs to be up or reskilled. Although there are existing structures and initiatives, we believe that much more must be done. \nAccording to the Swedish law “Högskolelagen” \" universities and University Colleges have the responsibility for lifelong learning, and Universities and University Colleges should collaborate and challenge existing structures to offer educational opportunities in new ways that scales, such as outside of formal curriculums (we believe the students are interested), professional education basis. \nGood small-scale examples with unexpectedly high interest:    \nAI for Executives - professional education offered by three universities in collaboration \nAI - Organization, value, and adoption - where hundreds of students learn about AI in an extracurricular activity\n\n\n\n\nDedicated investments on AI - Regions and Municipalities\n\nRegions and Municipalities have two significant challenges related to AI\nAccelerating their use of AI to manage how demographic changes will impact the available workforce\nMaking sure their regional private sectors adopt AI and maintain competitiveness.\nRegions and Municipalities should invest in their competence and use of AI, and make sure they participate in national collaboration. \nRegions and Municipalities should also invest in programs and projects enabling their regional private sectors to adopt AI. AI Sweden is one such structure that enables regions and municipalities to gain from national and collective investments and participate in active ecosystems and collaboration across sectors.\n\n\n\nCompetence and use of AI - Government agencies and State owned companies\n\nUnlike Regions and Municipalities, many Government agencies and State-owned companies lack \"natural\" urgency and incentives to reform through AI. Government agencies will be forced to change due to demographic challenges but for many state-owned companies, the government needs to create and communicate pressure for change to happen. Failure or inability to act will lead to erosion of relevance when citizens and taxpayers compare the outcome and services to other private and public organizations.\nBut regardless of government pressure or incentive, we recommend every government agency and state-owned company to proactively build AI competence, identify concrete use cases with both high potential and short development time, participate in national collaboration, and identify other organizations serving as good examples and inspiration.\n\n\n\nCompetence & leadership - Political parties\n\nPolitical parties should ensure that their relevance, decision-making, and ability to contribute to the positive development of society is built on a solid understanding of AI, its potential, and implications. \n  \nSpecifically, party leaders and other leading party representatives should demonstrate a basic understanding and be able to engage in discussions about use cases, potentials, and risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 2 - Scaling the efforts\nOne trend is very clear, the ones who understand AI the best, also invest the most. And they increase their efforts regularly. With the urgent actions above in place, decision-makers throughout society will rapidly be motivated to increase investments in scaling adoption and managing the benefits and challenges of AI. \nWhen this realization starts to happen broadly, we believe many more initiatives and changes will start to be relevant. These could include the following:\nA broad update of the educational system, both in terms of a broad use of AI-based learning tools, and new curriculums adapted to the way AI transforms society. In other words, not teach AI skills, but more of, for instance, interpersonal skills and collective intelligence  \nAn Increasing need and urgency to up- and reskill the existing workforce \nIncentivizing collaboration and the use of certain types of solutions throughout regions, municipalities, and government agencies, through conditional government grants and investments.\nStrongly improved regulations for international talent and workforce opportunities to choose and work in Sweden based on an international benchmark\nRevision of regulations on the use of public data, public procurement, and other obstacles to using AI. \nMandatory AI knowledge and skills among leaders and decision-makers in both the private and the public sector\nIntegrate AI-powered decision-making\nWe also believe investments will be necessary to compensate for the decentralized public sector and to address growing democratic issues related to welfare services not being provided at equal quality and cost by laggards compared to the best frontrunners. \nFurther, AI will be a driving force for deepened international collaboration within the EU, the Nordic countries, and NATO. Over time we expect there to be strong applied research bodies within some of these partnerships to accelerate the development, and Sweden will at the mid-term horizon need to focus on deployment rather than domestic research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3 - Manage an AI-driven future \nThe future society will be different from today’s. AI will come with many implications that we struggle to foresee today and that will likely need to be managed with a completely different set of tools (such as regulation, taxation, and governance) than today. \nNations that prepare early and intentionally establish cultures, foresight, and structures that enable adaptivity should have good chances to be the best at managing the economic, social, and other challenges the AI transformation might bring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 5\nResponsible use of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI has the potential to transform whole industries as well as society at large. It is of the highest importance that this is done in a safe, lawful, and responsible way to make sure people are not harmed directly or indirectly through applied AI solutions, while also unlocking the potential that AI brings.\nThe pace of AI development is extremely high. This brings a strong need for paying close attention to the implications of adopting AI while also building trust on a societal level and over time. Each AI use case has unique risks and considerations that require context-specific approaches. We also need to support experimentation and exploration as this is where potential risks are concretized and addressed. \nMoreover, due to the speed of development, we are not yet able to foresee all possible risks and opportunities with AI. It is therefore paramount that we build a strong AI ecosystem that is capable of applying responsible principles over time. A robust AI ecosystem requires national and international collaboration, active contribution and participation of stakeholders, and sharing of information and best practices.\nThe adoption of AI spans many fields, both technical such as data management and infrastructure, and non-technical areas such as behavioral sciences and people management. Given this, a multi-disciplinary approach throughout the lifecycle of AI development and application will increase our understanding of how AI solutions will be the most useful without producing undesirable results and the effect on society as a whole. \nFor organizations developing or using AI, we encourage using existing work done by organizations such as EU, NATO, OECD, and UNESCO, and we would like to place additional emphasis on some specific perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawfulness and transparency: All AI solutions should be developed and used within the rule of the law and stakeholders should be held accountable accordingly. We strongly advocate for proportionate and reasonable transparency about how AI systems are developed and work. This involves communicating the capabilities and limitations of AI understandably to all stakeholders, including end users and citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical and fair: AI systems must be designed and operated in a manner that respects human rights, values, and cultural diversity. This includes mitigating risks with AI algorithms such as bias and discrimination. It is essential to consider ethical implications at every stage of AI development and deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety and robustness: AI systems must be reliable, controllable, and secure. They should function as intended under various conditions and be resilient to manipulations and errors. This includes safeguarding against malicious use of AI technologies and ensuring that AI does not pose unintended harm to people or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming an agreement on the above principles, the challenge now lies in turning them into action and translating them into real-life scenarios and applications. Here, we have a responsibility to also use AI where appropriate and to address our time’s most pressing global challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI\nUNESCO: recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence\nOECD: OECD AI Principles overview\nEU AI Act Proposal\nNATO AI Strategy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership\nJoin 100+ partners across the public and private sectors as well as academia and research institutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't miss a beat!\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter updates, invites, and the latest from the Swedish AI ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the AI community!\nMy AI is a personalized platform, like 'LinkedIn for AI,' dedicated to the AI community and industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSign up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Martin Svensson\n\n\nManaging Director\nmartin.svensson@ai.se\n+46 (0)73-025 52 99\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mikael Ljungblom\n\n\nDirector of Public Policy & International Relations\nmikael.ljungblom@ai.se\n+46 (0)70-799 68 63"}

It requires bold leadership, scaled collaboration across sectors, and dedicated government investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Svensson\nManaging Director - AI Sweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many other countries, Sweden faces growing grand challenges such as increasing energy demand, demographics, crime, and national security. The consequences of the demographics alone turn the usage of AI and modern technology into a necessity, as the welfare sector otherwise would need 100% of the newly graduated workforce at the same time as there are limits to tax raises. Today’s solutions are simply not the solutions that will build the future of society. \nIn the private sector, many companies are seeing rapidly increasing international competition and signs of coming dramatic disruption, often driven by new possibilities enabled by AI. To preserve and strengthen its competitiveness, Sweden should make sure its private sector and not least, large exporting corporations increase their knowledge and investments in AI. \nCountries that early on have invested heavily in AI research and talent through research-focused strategies (e.g Canada) now face a crucial choice to invest beyond research and experimentation to enable adoption or lag behind. While others have to change their strategies, Sweden on the other hand has an opportunity to act fast and implement an adoption-focused strategy from the beginning. A bold strategy focused on generating value and adoption across industry and society would be a driver for collaboration, collective learning, and talent attraction. However, to succeed with such a strategy and compensate for the lack of early investments in AI, Sweden needs to collaborate with leading nations to access expertise and talent. \nSweden should act now and substantially invest in developing capabilities throughout sectors, throughout society. This Strategy therefore focuses on AI being adopted and generating sustainable value in the private and public sector, as well as across fields of research. \nFurther, the Strategy is inspired by the strategies of Canada, USA, UK, Germany, and Singapore. Several representatives for these countries have also been involved in the reference groups giving input and feedback. \nThis Strategy has been developed by the management of AI Sweden, the national center for applied AI with the mission to Accelerate the use of AI for the benefit of our society, our competitiveness, and for everyone living in Sweden, with feedback and input from two reference groups (to be disclosed when work completed). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis AI Strategy for Sweden consists of 5 parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVision\n\n\n\n\nFundamental standpoints & perspectives\n\n\n\n\nKey principles - The core strategy\n\n\n\n\nHigh-level Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nResponsible use of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 1\nVision - a desired future state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a desired future state Sweden should constitute a robust and highly attractive Swedish AI ecosystem enabling organizations to use AI for solving key societal and business challenges while contributing to a positive impact on our planet and people globally.\nWe believe that such an ecosystem will have the ambition and capabilities to substantially contribute to a great democratic society with a high quality of life, and societal and business solutions valuable to many other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 2\nFundamental standpoints and perspectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping this strategy, we have identified the following fundamental standpoints and perspectives, which we believe must be recognized by any decision-maker or organization for whom this strategy is relevant. \nThese standpoints and perspectives also directly guide the Key principles below. We have high confidence in the relevance and importance of these standpoints and perspectives but are aware that they may not represent a complete and deep analysis of the current view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe international private sector constantly expands its lead\n\n\n\n2\nThe extreme pace of development must be recognized and acted upon \n\n\n\n3\nAI technology is generally widely available\n\n\n\n4\nAdoption starts with leadership and deep knowledge throughout organizations\n\n\n\n5\nAI has unique properties requiring collaboration in ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - The international private sector constantly expands its lead\n\n\n\nThe last years have clearly shown that the use of AI at scale and profound breakthroughs happen in the private sector, not least in the USA. Companies with the resources, leadership, and talent lead the way and constantly increase their lead through a positive reinforcement loop of attracting more talent, generating more value, increasing investments, attracting more talent, and so on. \nThe trend is clear, organizations and companies understand AI the best and increase their investments the most. Consequently, the gap between the best and laggards continues to widen. As the value and potency of AI typically scale exponentially, the importance of not falling behind cannot be emphasized enough. \nTo stay relevant, we believe that Sweden should engage and learn from the best on all levels.\nReference: Hai AI Index report 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n2 - The extreme pace of development must be recognized and acted upon \n\n\n\nThe pace at which AI is being developed is unprecedented, lately demonstrated by generative AI. The pace is challenging companies and organizations in all sectors to expand their capabilities fast enough and for academic research on AI methodologies and technology to stay relevant. \nTo stay adaptive and maximize a nation's or a national ecosystem’s competitiveness new ways of working are necessary. This means that new incentives, new funding processes, and new ways of collaborating should be identified and deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - AI technology is generally widely available\n\n\n\nMature and powerful AI technologies are already today freely available or accessible as ready-to-be-used services, and the bottleneck for sustainable and valuable adoption is often leadership and competence to adopt. An important factor to successful adoption is also to look at transformational challenges both on individual, organizational, and societal levels. \nHence, a strategy aiming at accelerating the use of AI should prioritize investments driving adoption, economic growth, and benefits, such as initiatives driving collaboration, enabling access to existing technology, ensuring that the ecosystem includes service providers, building national computational infrastructure, and attracting talent at scale. \nAs AI technology is widely available and will lead to scaled adoption, research on the economic potential, societal value, consequences and safety of AI systems become increasingly important. In parallel, there is also the untapped potential of accelerating research in various fields (medicine, biology, materials, etc) by the involvement of AI expertise and the use of modern tools and technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 - Adoption starts with leadership and deep knowledge throughout organizations\n\n\n\nStrong and knowledgeable leadership deeply understanding the potential value of AI, setting direction, and making concrete investments is critical for any nation, organization, or company that wants to broadly benefit from the opportunities of AI. Lack of leadership increases the risks of AI being used in ways not aligned with responsible AI principles, not beneficial for society, or misaligned with other objectives.  \nFurther, to succeed the actual knowledge level and competence throughout companies, organizations, and government will determine how well and sustainably AI solutions will be built and deployed. \nAn AI strategy for Sweden should therefore immediately and forcefully strive to increase knowledge level and competence among both leaders and the overall workforce throughout society. \n\n\n\n\n\n5 - AI has unique properties requiring collaboration in ecosystems\n\n\n\nUnlike many technologies, the deployment and adoption of AI technology and solutions come with value creation and synergies across all sectors of society. Moreover, very few organizations/companies, or even nations, can build enough capability and competence themselves. Extensive collaboration is therefore essential and nations should recognize the need to invest in the building of AI ecosystems by facilitating and incentivizing collaboration. \nFor Sweden especially, with the high decentralization of the Swedish public sector (e.g. 21 regions, 290 municipalities, 350+ government agencies), collaboration becomes even more important as very few organizations individually are capable of building and managing necessary infrastructure, data, and solutions. Significant activities and investments compensation for decentralization must be put in place on all levels from government and downwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNästa\nFöregående\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The research community, industry, and Government play important, interconnected roles to enable the development and deployment of AI solutions. It is critical for Singapore to enhance partnerships across these stakeholders to strengthen our collective capabilities and drive our overall national AI effort.”\nFrom: Singapore's AI Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“With new opportunities, risks, and threats to prosperity and security at stake, the promise and peril associated with this foundational technology are too vast for any single actor to manage alone. As a result, cooperation is inherently needed to equally mitigate international security risks, as well as to capitalize on the technology’s potential to transform enterprise functions, mission support, and operations.”\nFrom: An Artificial Intelligence Strategy for NATO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore reading and background\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant strengths and weaknesses of Sweden\n\nWhen developing an AI strategy, Sweden has some comparative advantages and disadvantages worth considering. \nRelative to its size, Sweden has both many diverse exporting enterprises as well as a rich startup community, which should mean that many companies are exposed to competitive markets and need to be early adopters.\nSweden also ranks high on innovation and potential benefits of AI, has internationally recognized quality management, and has a history of successfully managing change both within organizations and for society at large. The culture of early delegation with a lack of management involvement can on the other side lead to slow AI adoption and poor prioritization.\nThe public sector is well organized and holds exceptionally valuable data, but is also highly decentralized with many small organizations facing difficulties in establishing relevant leadership, attracting relevant competence and investing according to the opportunities. Several other sectors are also lagging for similar reasons, not least the vast number of SMEs:s.\nThe education system is divided between humanities and science. The transformation initiated by AI implies the need for more workers skilled in several fields. Sweden has few programs overlapping disciplines and there are few indications that this will change during the coming years.\nLike many other EU nations, Sweden has focused on regulations rather than the combination of implementation and regulation. The latter is more common in North America and Asia which means these continents also learn about disadvantages and the need for relevant regulations.\n\n\n\nGlobal ranking\n\nAccording to the Global AI Index Sweden ranks as number 17 in total, and as follows in the seven categories:\nTalent - 15 \nInfrastructure - 21 \nOperating Environment - 2\nResearch - 13\nDevelopment - 17\nGovernment Strategy - 44\nCommercial - 16  \nWhat clearly stands out is the lack of Government Strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 3\nKey principles - the core strategy & mindset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Principles constitute the core of this strategy and should serve as a mindset that permeates, guides, and aligns actions, investments, and initiatives associated with this strategy. \nIf all relevant actions or investments were based and mapped against these principles we believe Sweden would quickly see positive effects and over time maximize the long-term impact throughout the ecosystem. \nAs an example, an AI commission at the government level should collaborate with the best international peers, be structured across ministries, attract some of the best talent for the assignment, and catalyze investments and actions according to all Key principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngage and learn from the best nations and international organizations\nGiven the pace of development internationally and that many of the objectives are best managed on an international level, Sweden should actively seek partnerships with like-minded countries, companies, research institutes, non-profit organizations, think tanks, and individuals, especially where there is a ground for mutual learning and development. \nInternational collaboration should preferably be focused and result in a high density of interactions with selected ecosystems. \nIn parallel, Sweden must make it easier for international talent to stay, study, work, live, and remain in Sweden, as well as incentivize and enable the private and public sectors to recruit talent internationally.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantially increase the knowledge level and competence everywhere in the ecosystem \nA higher level of knowledge leads to better insights and understanding of what investments, actions, and competence are needed, and as a key principle leaders throughout society should strive to increase the knowledge level and add competence (knowledgeable talent and workforce) in their respective organization, whether that is within government, private companies, public organizations, ministries, government agencies or academia. \nFurther, all initiatives quickly increasing the overall competence in the ecosystem should be incentivized and prioritized. More competence is necessary at all levels of education and in all professional roles relevant to AI adoption (not least leaders, change makers, legal experts, AI practitioners, and domain experts). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in strategic resources that can be shared with many \nIncentives and funding for the development of strategic and important resources for sovereignty, independence, and scaled adoption (such as national computational infrastructure, Swedish large language models, methods for how to build decentralized systems, AI adoption tools for leaders, etc) should be built in broad collaborations and made available as widely as possible. \nAI Sweden (among others) has demonstrated that the willingness among international and Swedish companies and organizations to jointly invest in knowledge and strategic resources enabling the adoption of AI is significant. When structured on a truly collaborative basis and with strong sharing mechanisms (such as My AI), the return on investment can be significant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the best to perform even better and incentivize them to share generously \nBy identifying and recognizing forerunners, i.e. companies and organizations investing and demonstrating real value by AI, Sweden would quickly reinforce a pay-it-forward culture encouraging responsibility, change, investments, and collaboration. \nAmbitious forerunners also exist in both private and public sectors in Sweden. These companies and organizations should be enabled and incentivized to move even faster and generate more value given that they share generously with others in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild an ecosystem and scale collaboration across sectors\nTo foster and drive collaboration, Sweden should scale initiatives that build the ecosystem and facilitate collaboration. This should include a strong ambition to compensate for the high decentralization of the public sector through investments in collaboration and sharing, both between several public organizations and between public and private organizations. \nFacilitation of collaboration should include incentives for consortiums to build joint advanced solutions, structures, and regulations enabling access to real-world data and in general build on mechanisms that allow fast pace and adaptivity. \n \nSweden should also consider investing in one or two “moonshots”, e.g. large-scale initiatives where many actors come together to solve a grand challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nOECD overview of national AI strategies (from 2021)\nUSA National AI R&D Strategy\nUSA National Security Strategy on AI \nUSA  NATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN, 2023 UPDATE \nStrengthening and Democratization the U.S. AI Innovation System\nPan-Canadian AI Strategy\nUK National AI Strategy\nSingapore National AI Strategy\nJapan Revised AI Strategy\nNorway National Strategy AI\nDenmark National Strategy for AI\nAustralia Strategy for Generative AI\nNATO AI Strategy\nEU thoughts on AI Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 4\nHigh-level Roadmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRealizing that AI is necessary to solve today's societal challenges, and given the suggested Key principles, what action would be necessary to best and in the shortest possible time contribute to the Vision, i.e. an ecosystem with ambition and capabilities to substantially contribute to a great democratic society with a high quality of life, and societal and business solutions valuable to Sweden and other countries? \nEarly 2024 the Swedish AI ecosystem is well prepared and Sweden stands a good chance to benefit from AI. The Swedish private sector is highly diverse, has a strong track record of being innovative, and includes several significant frontrunners. The interest in AI and the collaborative spirit in the public sector are quickly growing and good examples of valuable solutions are being deployed. The combination of WASP’s investment in fundamental research and talent, and AI Sweden's dedicated effort to driving adoption across sectors, is from what we can see a unique strength that few countries can match. \nThis High-level Roadmap therefore focuses on the critical aspects that still are missing and that we believe would have a high impact. These center around national, i.e. government initiated, leadership, investments, and other efforts to scale the benefits of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1 - Actions with high impact\nAmong the knowledgeable leaders in academia and the private and public sectors, we see a clear consensus that Sweden needs to act urgently to ensure its competitiveness and continuous ability to develop its welfare. A number of highly prioritized actions should be put in place immediately, below the most critical. Below are the most urgent, preferably acted upon during 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn process\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National AI commission - Government\n\nThe Swedish government has announced an AI commission that is tasked to analyze and come up with concrete proposals on how AI can promote Sweden as a leading research nation, advanced industrial nation and ambitious welfare nation.\nThis is an excellent step that should lead to concrete deliverables that the government acts upon starting 2024 and further alignment among key stakeholders in the Swedish AI ecosystem. \nPress release \nDirective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrgent\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment competence, leadership and direction - Government\n\nThe government should show clear direction and leadership. Given the highly decentralized Swedish public sector and the large number of leaders and decision-makers on various levels, government leadership and direction become even more important.  \nGovernment leadership and direction should for instance include Clearly appointing a minister responsible for AI, preferably with horizontal responsibilities across ministries\nIdentify and communicate the potential in the private and public sector\nSet a strategy toward realizing such potential \nEstablish active international collaboration with leading nations and participation in relevant international initiatives and decision-making (not least in the European Union)\nClearly separate AI from the broadly used term digitalization\nThe Government should also actively increase competence and use of AI throughout the government office (“Regeringskansliet”). Ideally, each ministry would appoint two to three knowledgeable and responsible for AI-related questions, as well as having access to coordinating and strategic expertise available for government and government offices.\n\n\n\nDedicated investments on AI - Government\n\nAI is likely the strongest driving force behind the mentioned transformation of society and key leaders in Sweden, such as business leaders, policy-makers, and leaders within the government should immediately start discussing AI according to its magnitude and investing to realize the identified potential. \nDedicated investments are necessary to demonstrate leadership, substantially increase the knowledge level, build strategic resources build an active ecosystem, and scale collaboration across sectors. The investments should be ramped up towards an ambitious level related to the identified potential.\nAnd, the potential is very high. According to DIGG, in the public sector alone and based on available technology by 2019 (i.e. long before generative AI) the estimated potential is SEK 140 billion per year, or more than SEK 10 billion in missed opportunity for every month that passes without action. \nGovernment investments will be matched by minimum corresponding investments in both the private and public sectors, and lead to ripple effects and clearly higher economic value throughout the ecosystem. One example is this report from Teknikföretagen. \nAccording to An AI Strategy for Sweden, government investments in AI should include funding programs that lead to a substantial increase in the knowledge level in the ecosystem, develop strategic resources that are shared with many, enable frontrunners to move faster and share generously, scales the building of the AI ecosystem and collaboration across sectors, and incentivizes international collaboration with leading nations and organizations.\nWe recommend that the overall investments in AI include significant investments through Vinnova, where the collaborative structures, ecosystems, and knowledge already are in place. \nFor reference, one of the most natural countries for Sweden to collaborate with is Canada where between 2022 and 2023, $2.57 billion was invested in AI research in the country, as total AI investment reached $8.64 billion. See more here. \nFurther on the top 10 Countries Leading in AI Research and technology in 2023, see here.\n\n\n\nIncrease investments in innovation in general - Government & Ministry of Climate and Enterprise\n\nWith the pace of technological development and demonstrated value and implications, we can conclude that we are in the early phase of significantly transformative times. Perhaps the most transformative times in history. In such times, government general investments driving innovation, applied research and change are more important than ever. \nGeneral investments in innovation and applied research advance development in many sectors and as one effect of many, lead to better generation, higher maturity, and availability of data and data management.\nSweden should make sure it is on par with nations investing the most related to its GDP. \nAgain we recommend building on existing structures, and within the total investments in innovation in general, include significantly increased investments through Vinnova.\n\n\n\nUpskilling and reskilling - Ministry of Education and Research\n\nBroad programs should be put in place to add AI skills to all educational fields and levels, as well as programs incentivizing both private and public sectors to invest in up- and reskilling of the existing workforce. This is especially important for non-STEM education. \nIntroducing new courses in existing curriculums in Universities and University Colleges has proven to take a long time and the Ministry of Education and Research should act to both incentivize and force change, as well as establish new ways for the educational system to bring AI to their students.\n\n\n\nUpskilling and reskilling - Universities and University Colleges\n\nThe transformation of society means that a large share of the existing workforce needs to be up or reskilled. Although there are existing structures and initiatives, we believe that much more must be done. \nAccording to the Swedish law “Högskolelagen” \" universities and University Colleges have the responsibility for lifelong learning, and Universities and University Colleges should collaborate and challenge existing structures to offer educational opportunities in new ways that scales, such as outside of formal curriculums (we believe the students are interested), professional education basis. \nGood small-scale examples with unexpectedly high interest:    \nAI for Executives - professional education offered by three universities in collaboration \nAI - Organization, value, and adoption - where hundreds of students learn about AI in an extracurricular activity\n\n\n\n\nDedicated investments on AI - Regions and Municipalities\n\nRegions and Municipalities have two significant challenges related to AI\nAccelerating their use of AI to manage how demographic changes will impact the available workforce\nMaking sure their regional private sectors adopt AI and maintain competitiveness.\nRegions and Municipalities should invest in their competence and use of AI, and make sure they participate in national collaboration. \nRegions and Municipalities should also invest in programs and projects enabling their regional private sectors to adopt AI. AI Sweden is one such structure that enables regions and municipalities to gain from national and collective investments and participate in active ecosystems and collaboration across sectors.\n\n\n\nCompetence and use of AI - Government agencies and State owned companies\n\nUnlike Regions and Municipalities, many Government agencies and State-owned companies lack \"natural\" urgency and incentives to reform through AI. Government agencies will be forced to change due to demographic challenges but for many state-owned companies, the government needs to create and communicate pressure for change to happen. Failure or inability to act will lead to erosion of relevance when citizens and taxpayers compare the outcome and services to other private and public organizations.\nBut regardless of government pressure or incentive, we recommend every government agency and state-owned company to proactively build AI competence, identify concrete use cases with both high potential and short development time, participate in national collaboration, and identify other organizations serving as good examples and inspiration.\n\n\n\nCompetence & leadership - Political parties\n\nPolitical parties should ensure that their relevance, decision-making, and ability to contribute to the positive development of society is built on a solid understanding of AI, its potential, and implications. \n  \nSpecifically, party leaders and other leading party representatives should demonstrate a basic understanding and be able to engage in discussions about use cases, potentials, and risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 2 - Scaling the efforts\nOne trend is very clear, the ones who understand AI the best, also invest the most. And they increase their efforts regularly. With the urgent actions above in place, decision-makers throughout society will rapidly be motivated to increase investments in scaling adoption and managing the benefits and challenges of AI. \nWhen this realization starts to happen broadly, we believe many more initiatives and changes will start to be relevant. These could include the following:\nA broad update of the educational system, both in terms of a broad use of AI-based learning tools, and new curriculums adapted to the way AI transforms society. In other words, not teach AI skills, but more of, for instance, interpersonal skills and collective intelligence  \nAn Increasing need and urgency to up- and reskill the existing workforce \nIncentivizing collaboration and the use of certain types of solutions throughout regions, municipalities, and government agencies, through conditional government grants and investments.\nStrongly improved regulations for international talent and workforce opportunities to choose and work in Sweden based on an international benchmark\nRevision of regulations on the use of public data, public procurement, and other obstacles to using AI. \nMandatory AI knowledge and skills among leaders and decision-makers in both the private and the public sector\nIntegrate AI-powered decision-making\nWe also believe investments will be necessary to compensate for the decentralized public sector and to address growing democratic issues related to welfare services not being provided at equal quality and cost by laggards compared to the best frontrunners. \nFurther, AI will be a driving force for deepened international collaboration within the EU, the Nordic countries, and NATO. Over time we expect there to be strong applied research bodies within some of these partnerships to accelerate the development, and Sweden will at the mid-term horizon need to focus on deployment rather than domestic research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3 - Manage an AI-driven future \nThe future society will be different from today’s. AI will come with many implications that we struggle to foresee today and that will likely need to be managed with a completely different set of tools (such as regulation, taxation, and governance) than today. \nNations that prepare early and intentionally establish cultures, foresight, and structures that enable adaptivity should have good chances to be the best at managing the economic, social, and other challenges the AI transformation might bring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 5\nResponsible use of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI has the potential to transform whole industries as well as society at large. It is of the highest importance that this is done in a safe, lawful, and responsible way to make sure people are not harmed directly or indirectly through applied AI solutions, while also unlocking the potential that AI brings.\nThe pace of AI development is extremely high. This brings a strong need for paying close attention to the implications of adopting AI while also building trust on a societal level and over time. Each AI use case has unique risks and considerations that require context-specific approaches. We also need to support experimentation and exploration as this is where potential risks are concretized and addressed. \nMoreover, due to the speed of development, we are not yet able to foresee all possible risks and opportunities with AI. It is therefore paramount that we build a strong AI ecosystem that is capable of applying responsible principles over time. A robust AI ecosystem requires national and international collaboration, active contribution and participation of stakeholders, and sharing of information and best practices.\nThe adoption of AI spans many fields, both technical such as data management and infrastructure, and non-technical areas such as behavioral sciences and people management. Given this, a multi-disciplinary approach throughout the lifecycle of AI development and application will increase our understanding of how AI solutions will be the most useful without producing undesirable results and the effect on society as a whole. \nFor organizations developing or using AI, we encourage using existing work done by organizations such as EU, NATO, OECD, and UNESCO, and we would like to place additional emphasis on some specific perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawfulness and transparency: All AI solutions should be developed and used within the rule of the law and stakeholders should be held accountable accordingly. We strongly advocate for proportionate and reasonable transparency about how AI systems are developed and work. This involves communicating the capabilities and limitations of AI understandably to all stakeholders, including end users and citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical and fair: AI systems must be designed and operated in a manner that respects human rights, values, and cultural diversity. This includes mitigating risks with AI algorithms such as bias and discrimination. It is essential to consider ethical implications at every stage of AI development and deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety and robustness: AI systems must be reliable, controllable, and secure. They should function as intended under various conditions and be resilient to manipulations and errors. This includes safeguarding against malicious use of AI technologies and ensuring that AI does not pose unintended harm to people or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming an agreement on the above principles, the challenge now lies in turning them into action and translating them into real-life scenarios and applications. Here, we have a responsibility to also use AI where appropriate and to address our time’s most pressing global challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI\nUNESCO: recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence\nOECD: OECD AI Principles overview\nEU AI Act Proposal\nNATO AI Strategy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership\nJoin 100+ partners across the public and private sectors as well as academia and research institutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't miss a beat!\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter updates, invites, and the latest from the Swedish AI ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the AI community!\nMy AI is a personalized platform, like 'LinkedIn for AI,' dedicated to the AI community and industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSign up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Martin Svensson\n\n\nManaging Director\nmartin.svensson@ai.se\n+46 (0)73-025 52 99\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mikael Ljungblom\n\n\nDirector of Public Policy & International Relations\nmikael.ljungblom@ai.se\n+46 (0)70-799 68 63"}

We are now ready for a new round starting in January 2024 and are looking to start the program in Gothenburg, Linköping, Luleå, Lund and Örebro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing upon the valuable insights shared by students and the wealth of experience gained from previous program cycles, we aim to provide support to the new cohort of students in some of the tasks that are well-known for being commonly overlooked. We invite the students to a series of workshops (once a month from February to April) to help them develop their soft skills, such as giving a talk and writing a master thesis. They will be welcomed into our offices for the period of their thesis work and we will offer a quiet space, access to our infrastructure and technical support, not to mention a friendly environment.\nIs your organization interested in gaining value and new perspectives from masters students at some of the top universities in Sweden?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to take part (as a supervisor)\nPlease register your interest by sending an email with a description of your suggested topic for one or more master theses to sofia.heden@ai.se and chiara.ceccobello@ai.se and post it on My.AI under Resources/Master Thesis Proposals by October 31.\nThe description should include:\nName of the project\nShort description of the topic\nYour organization\nYour contact person and email address\nPreferred student background\n​Preferred location\nThe thesis work will begin in January 2024. We will help you spread the word and recruit the best students for your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can partners expect?\nStudent-industry collaborations are mutually beneficial. They create opportunities to share new insights and points of view while building competence and expertise on both sides.\nBenefit from the knowledge of master students to solve current problems or dig deeper into existing tasks. Boost attractiveness to possible future employees by joining these collaborations. Opportunity to recruit students directly before they graduate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to take part (as a student)\nIf you already have an AI-related thesis, express your interest in the program by sending your application. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend in your application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rarely provide master thesis projects from AI Sweden, but encourage you to go to My AI to find suggestions from partners and other organizations in the AI ecosystem. You will find suggestions under Resources - Master Thesis (Resurser - Exjobbsförslag). The page will be updated with new proposals regularly.\nIf you are looking for a thesis topic/project, go to My.AI under Resources/Master Thesis and contact the reference person of the master thesis project that interests you and hopefully, we will see you around in January. Once you find a project, send your application to participate in the program here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can candidates expect?\nValuable experience from working with real projects and applying theoretical knowledge.\nA community where you can benefit from each other’s experiences and challenges in different organizations and sectors.\nAttend exclusive events, lectures, and other activities.\nWorking with the best in the field across Sweden.\nAbout the program\nStudents who enter the program work on the topics that matter most to partners and sit at one of our locations. They benefit from events and seminars from AI Sweden experts during the spring focused on growing their soft skills and providing extra support on common struggles, such as the writing process and defining and sticking to the research question that they want to address in their thesis work.

Organizations that are increasing their focus on AI can benefit from getting aligned behind a vision that creates a better understanding of AI and its place in the organization. Without a vision, organizations risk putting too little focus on the most valuable projects, or worse; spending resources on the wrong ones. In a recent report, McKinsey found that companies that see the highest return on investment from AI are much more likely to have a clearly defined AI vision and strategy.  However, developing an AI vision can be complicated and achieving the intended impact can be hard. Not much guidance has so far been produced on what goes into an AI vision and there have been few best practice references. \nThe white paper is a guide developed to help organizations create their AI vision faster and with better results. This practical tool is the product of AI Swedens and the collaborating partners' combined experiences. It explains what an AI vision is, the process of creating it and how to communicate it. In addition to the white paper, an easy-to-use template accompanies it.  \nWho can benefit from using the white paper?\nPrivate or public, any organization that wants to work more with AI could benefit from it. Ideally, an AI vision is developed after the organization has developed its first experiments or proof of concepts. The AI vision serves as a roadmap for further scaling. \nWhy did we create the AI Vision White Paper?\n“We wanted to create this white paper because it is something all of us would have loved to have access to when we first started working on setting an AI strategy. By getting this paper out, the hope is to help other organizations speed up their process and bring clarity,” says Lucas Ambjörn, Expert in Digitization and AI Transformation at Zenseact, one of the contributors to the whitepaper. \nAnother contributor, Cecilia Hahn Berg, Strategist for Life Science at Sahlgrenska University Hospital also shares her view on how the paper could benefit organizations:\n “Spending 30 minutes reading through the white paper will hopefully pay back in at least two ways. Firstly, to speed up the process of deciding if an AI vision will benefit your organization at all. Second, the white paper will help you understand how to set up the process to create an AI vision.” \nCollaborating across sectors \nThe AI Vision White Paper was developed by a broad combination of organizations, ranging from public to private and from large to medium-sized. The work was done in a series of workshops spanning over three months. “We could build in all our knowledge in the paper from different companies and authorities,” says Anders Fryden, AI coordinator and Change Manager at the Swedish Tax Agency. Cecilia Hahn Berg added that “the wide-ranging perspectives hopefully result in a white paper that is applicable to a broader audience.” \nDuring the workshops, the group gathered knowledge and inspiration from other sources as well as sharing their own experiences. \nThe AI Vision White Paper is available in both English and Swedish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Vision White Paper and template in English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t AI Vision White Paper (eng)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1.13 MB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Vision template (eng)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t58.97 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Vision White Paper och mall på svenska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Vision White Paper (sv)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1.02 MB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Vision mall (sv)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t32.97 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Conny Svensson\n\n\nDirector of AI Adoption\nconny.svensson@ai.se\n+46 (0)70-315 94 98"}

Organisationer som ökar sitt fokus på AI kan dra nytta av att bli samordnade bakom en vision som skapar en bättre förståelse för AI och dess plats i organisationen. Utan en vision riskerar organisationer att lägga för lite fokus på de mest värdefulla projekten, eller ännu värre; att spendera resurser på de fel projekten. I en ny rapport, fann McKinsey att företag som ser den högsta avkastningen på investeringar från AI är mycket mer benägna att ha en tydligt definierad AI-vision och strategi. Att utveckla en AI-vision kan dock vara komplicerat och det kan vara svårt att uppnå den avsedda påverkan. Hittills har inte mycket vägledning producerats om vad som ingår i en AI-vision och det har funnits få bästa praxis referenser.\nVitboken är en guide utvecklad för att hjälpa organisationer att skapa sin AI-vision snabbare och med bättre resultat. Detta praktiska verktyg är produkten av AI Swedens och de samarbetande partnernas samlade erfarenheter. Den förklarar vad en AI-vision är, processen att skapa den och hur man kommunicerar den. Förutom vitboken medföljer en lättanvänd mall. \nVilka kan dra nytta av att detta material?\nPrivata eller offentliga, alla organisationer som vill arbeta mer med AI kan dra nytta av den. Idealiskt utvecklas en AI-vision efter att organisationen har utvecklat sina första experiment eller proof of concepts. AI-visionen fungerar som en färdplan för vidare skalning.\nVarför tog vi fram AI Vision White Paper?\n\"Vi ville skapa denna vitbok eftersom det är något som alla av oss skulle ha älskat att ha tillgång till när vi först började arbeta med att sätta en AI-strategi. Genom att få ut detta dokument hoppas vi hjälpa andra organisationer att accelerera sin process och skapa klarhet,\" säger Lucas Ambjörn, Expert på Digitalisering och AI Transformation på Zenseact, en av bidragsgivarna till vitboken.\nEn annan bidragsgivare, Cecilia Hahn Berg, Strateg för Life Science på Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, delar också sin syn på hur pappret kan gynna organisationer:\n\"Att tillbringa 30 minuter med att läsa igenom vitboken kommer förhoppningsvis att betala sig på minst två sätt. För det första, för att accelerera processen att bestämma om en AI-vision kommer att gynna din organisation överhuvudtaget. För det andra kommer vitboken att hjälpa dig att förstå hur du ställer in processen för att skapa en AI-vision.\"\nSamarbeta över sektorer\nVitboken om AI-vision utvecklades av en bred kombination av organisationer, från offentliga till privata och från stora till medelstora. Arbetet utfördes i en serie workshops som sträckte sig över tre månader. \"Vi kunde bygga in all vår kunskap i dokumentet från olika företag och myndigheter\", säger Anders Fryden, AI samordnare och Change Manager på Skatteverket. Cecilia Hahn Berg tillade att \"de varierande perspektiven förhoppningsvis resulterar i en vitbok som gäller för en bredare publik.\"\nUnder workshops samlade gruppen kunskap och inspiration från andra källor samt delade sina egna erfarenheter.\nVitboken om AI Vision finns tillgänglig både på engelska och svenska.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Vision White Paper and template in English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t AI Vision White Paper (eng)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1.13 MB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Vision template (eng)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t58.97 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Vision White Paper och mall på svenska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Vision White Paper (sv)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1.02 MB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Vision mall (sv)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t32.97 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFör mer information, kontakta\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Conny Svensson\n\n\nDirector of AI Adoption\nconny.svensson@ai.se\n+46 (0)70-315 94 98"}

But you need to understand what AI can do so that you can have an understanding of how the technology affects your organization – both as a force that transforms the reality your organization exists in but more importantly how AI can be used as a tool within your organization.\nMake sure to check out the executive program “AI for executives” which is intended for non-technical decision makers who want to develop their understanding of how to strategically implement AI in their organization. The program is developed by the executive education units at Stockholm University, Uppsala University, and Gothenburg University, in collaboration with AI Sweden.\nYou can also listen to our podcast AI för ledare och CxO:er and take the self-paced, free course “Get started with AI”, and then continue with “Level up”. \nFor inspiration on what others do with the help of AI, do not miss out on exploring the use case library at My AI.\n\n\n\nHow do we start using AI?\n\nFor organizations to truly adopt AI, it is necessary to change ways of working, processes, and structures. This makes it a question for decision-makers and top levels of every organization. To embark on this transformative journey, organizations can use a step-by-step approach that focuses on key enablers —Technology, Data & Infrastructure, Organization, Ecosystem, and Expertise. By doing so, organizations can generate sustainable value using AI. Read more about how to adopt AI and accelerate your organization's AI maturity here.\n\n\n\nHow do I make strategic decisions about AI in my organizations?\n\nTo scale and move forward you need to understand where your organization stands today. Doing an AI maturity assessment is one way to understand the current state of your organization’s AI maturity and gives you a clear idea of where to go next. \nHaving an AI vision is another way to approach AI strategically. The AI Vision White Paper is a tool that helps organizations put an AI vision in place.\n\n\n\nHow do I develop the right AI competence in my organization?\n\nFor partners to AI Sweden, there are talent programs you can join. Some run over a few weeks, others are 1,5 years. This way, we address various partner needs and at the same time boost talent with relevant knowledge.\nBut recruiting is not the only way of course. There are also resources for upskilling that you can check out.\n\n\n\nHow do others use AI in my sector?\n\nExplore the use case library at MyAI. But do not only look at what others in your sector do with AI. Since artificial intelligence is a general technology, we find that many organizations can learn from each other as they share the same challenges - do not hesitate to find inspiration outside of your sector as well.\nAI Sweden also has sector-specific networks that might be of interest to you. Once you are a partner, get in touch with your key contact to get more information.\n\n\n\nHow do we become partners to AI Sweden?\n\nFirst, read more about the partnership. Second, find your sector contact and get in touch for further discussions.\n\n\n\nHow can AI be used in politics?\n\nJust as for any other organization - AI will be key for a well-functioning government. Read more about the organizational perspective here. \nBut perhaps even more important, AI is a key component for fulfilling almost every societal goal in a country. As a political decision maker, you will be making priorities for an entire sector or an entire country. Understanding the strategic dimension of AI, financial and political priorities, and developing sound policy will be a pillar for any politician who wants to be relevant in our world today.

Artificiell intelligens öppnar upp nya möjligheter. Att införa AI kräver att man fattar strategiska beslut. Se till att de rätta intressenterna är involverade. Prioritera mellan användningsfall. Bygg partnerskap med de bästa där ute. Allokera signifikanta och relevanta resurser. Skapa en miljö för organisatoriskt lärande. AI Sweden har mycket resurser för att hjälpa till i denna process, beroende på var du och din organisation befinner er idag.\n \nHåll dig uppdaterad med de senaste nyheterna genom att prenumerera på vårt nyhetsbrev för beslutsfattare\n\n\n\n\n\nVad behöver jag veta om AI?\n\nSom beslutsfattare behöver du inte sträva efter djup teknisk kunskap om artificiell intelligens. Men du behöver förstå vad AI kan göra så att du kan förstå hur tekniken påverkar din organisation - både som en kraft som omvandlar verkligheten som din organisation existerar i och, mer viktigt, hur AI kan användas som ett verktyg inom din organisation.\nProgrammet AI for executives är avsett för icke-tekniska beslutsfattare som vill utveckla sin förståelse för hur man strategiskt implementerar AI i sin organisation. Programmet är utvecklat av enheterna för chefsutbildning vid Stockholms universitet, Uppsala universitet och Göteborgs universitet, i samarbete med AI Sweden.\nDu kan också lyssna på vår podcast AI för ledare och CxO:er och gå den kostnadsfria kursen Starta din AI-resa i den takt som passar dig, och sedan fortsätta med Level up.\nFör inspiration om vad andra gör med hjälp av AI, missa inte att utforska use case-biblioteket på My AI.\n\n\n\nHur börjar vi använda AI?\n\nFör att organisationer verkligen ska kunna växla ut värdet av AI är det nödvändigt att inte bara se det som en teknisk resurs utan också ändra arbetssätt, processer och strukturer. Detta gör det till en fråga för beslutsfattare på högsta nivån inom varje organisation. Ett sätt för organisationer att ta sig an AI-resan är genom ett steg-för-steg tillvägagångssätt som fokuserar på nyckelfaktorer - Teknologi, Data & Infrastruktur, Organisation, Ekosystem och Expertis. Genom detta kan organisationer generera hållbart värde med hjälp av AI. Läs mer om hur du kan införa AI och accelerera din organisations AI-mognad här.\n\n\n\nHur fattar jag strategiska beslut om AI i mina organisationer?\n\nEtt första steg är att göra en AI Maturity Assessment. Det ger både insikt i var din organisation står idag och ger en förståelse för att sätta rätt riktning framåt.\nAtt ha en AI-vision är ett annat sätt att strategiskt närma sig AI. AI Vision White Paper är ett verktyg som hjälper organisationer att införa en AI-vision.\n\n\n\nHur utvecklar jag rätt AI-kompetens i min organisation?\n\nPartners till AI Sweden kan engagera sig i våra talangprogram för att attrahera ny kompetens.

Vinnova and AI Sweden are currently carrying out a four-year collaboration where municipalities and civil society receive tailored assistance to understand how AI can be used and the opportunity to seek funding for concrete projects.Please note that videos and other resources on this page will be in Swedish. For the full Swedish version, simply switch language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nHow can artificial intelligence assist municipalities and civil society organizations? Throughout the country, there are already inspiring examples. In Helsingborg, computer vision is used to monitor the condition of road networks. In Strängnäs, text analysis is being explored to support social services caseworkers. In Skövde, AI helps ensure that incoming inquiries to the contact center are directed to the right staff members. For organizations like the Red Cross, Myrorna, and Björkå Frihet, computer vision becomes a tool for sorting used clothing.\nHowever, this is just a surface-level list of what is possible. AI Sweden and Vinnova, Sweden's innovation agency, are now seeking municipalities and civil society organizations interested in learning more about how artificial intelligence can become a tool in their operations.\n \n\"With the help of AI, we can develop the common welfare in new ways and more efficiently address significant societal challenges. It is essential that Sweden's municipalities and civil society are part of this journey.\" - Darja Isaksson, Director-General of Vinnova\n\nAs part of the Collaboration for AI in Municipalities and Civil Society, AI Sweden will support municipalities and civil society organizations in various practical ways. Participants will receive training, workshops, and access to AI Sweden's network. For project ideas that receive funding from Vinnova's targeted calls, additional support will be provided during the project period.\nA Platform for Collaboration\nUnderstanding and then effectively utilizing the possibilities of artificial intelligence are challenges that it is not reasonable for every municipality in the country to tackle individually. Therefore, a central aspect is to create a platform for collaboration and exchange of experiences among municipalities. There are significant synergies to be gained, as the needs of one municipality often recur in many of the other 289 municipalities in the country. Similarly, civil society comprises a wide range of organizations, but there are also many common challenges to learn from and share experiences.\nTo achieve the greatest possible impact, the ambition is to involve as many municipalities and civil society actors as possible in this collaboration. The crucial factor is not whether AI is being used today but whether there is curiosity about how a completely new toolbox can be harnessed for your operations. Does this description align with you and your organization? Get in touch!\nThis collaboration should be viewed as a complement to other initiatives aimed at increasing the use of AI in the public sector and is carried out in cooperation with the Agency for Digital Government, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, and the Agency for Youth and Civil Society Affairs.\nDo you want to stay updated on what's happening in the project? Fill out our contact form, and you'll be added to our mailing list!

Vinnova och AI Sweden genomför nu en fyraårig kraftsamling där kommuner och civilsamhälle får skräddarsydd hjälp att förstå hur AI kan användas och möjlighet att söka finansiering till konkreta projekt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBakgrund\nHur kan artificiell intelligens hjälpa kommuner och organisationer i civilsamhället? Runt om i landet finns redan exempel att inspireras av. I Helsingborg används datorseende för att hålla koll på hur vägnätet mår. I Strängnäs utforskas hur textanalys kan stötta handläggarna i socialförvaltningen. I Skövde hjälper AI till att se till att inkommande frågor till kontaktcentret hamnar hos rätt medarbetare. För Röda Korset, Myrorna och Björkå Frihet blir datorseende ett verktyg för att sortera begagnade kläder.\nMen det här är en lista som bara skrapar på ytan av vad som är möjligt. AI Sweden och Vinnova, Sveriges innovationsmyndighet, söker nu efter kommuner och organisationer som vill lära mer om hur artificiell intelligens kan bli ett verktyg i verksamheten.\n\n“Med hjälp av AI kan vi utveckla den gemensamma välfärden på nya sätt och effektivare tackla stora samhällsutmaningar. Det är centralt att Sveriges kommuner och civilsamhället är med på den resan.”\n– Darja Isaksson, generaldirektör Vinnova\n\nInom ramen för Kraftsamling för AI i kommuner och civilsamhälle kommer AI Sweden att stötta kommuner och organisationer i civilsamhället på ett antal olika sätt i det praktiska genomförandet. Via projektet får deltagare utbildningar, workshops och tillgång till AI Swedens nätverk. För projektidéer som beviljas finansiering i någon av Vinnovas riktade utlysningar tillkommer dessutom stöd under projektperioden. \nEn plattform för samverkan\nAtt först förstå och sedan i praktiken dra nytta av möjligheterna med artificiell intelligens är utmaningar som inte är rimliga att landets alla kommuner ger sig i kast med var och en för sig. En central del blir därför att skapa en plattform för samverkan och erfarenhetsutbyte kommuner emellan. Här finns stora synergieffekter att hämta hem, eftersom behoven hos en kommun ofta återkommer i många av landets övriga 289. Civilsamhället i sin tur består av många olika typer av organisationer men även här att det finns många gemensamma utmaningar att lära från och dela erfarenheter av.\nFör att arbetet ska få största tänkbara effekt är ambitionen att koppla så många kommuner och aktörer från civilsamhället som möjligt till kraftsamlingen. Det avgörande är inte om man använder AI idag, det avgörande är om man är nyfiken på hur verksamheten kan utnyttja en helt ny verktygslåda. Stämmer du och din organisation in på den beskrivningen? Hör av dig!\nKraftsamlingen ska ses som ett komplement till andra satsningar som finns för att öka användningen av AI i offentlig sektor och sker i samverkan med Myndigheten för digital förvaltning, Sveriges Kommuner och Regioner och Myndigheten för ungdoms- och civilsamhällesfrågor. \nVill du hålla dig uppdaterad om vad som händer i projektet? Fyll i vårt kontaktformulär så hamnar du på vår utskickslista!

På samma sätt utvecklas också vårt yrkeskunnande.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHur ska vi agera?\nModul 6\nVi behöver etablera en gemensam grundläggande förståelse för området där vi verkar – för yrkeskunskapen och den praxis som etablerats inom yrkesområdet i stort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduktion - Modul 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKursen vänder sig till yrkeserfarna i organisationer där artificiell intelligens (AI) har blivit, eller är på väg att bli, en del av verksamheten.\nVi kommer att belysa AI från ett kunskapsperspektiv och behandla vardagsfrågor inom yrket där vi ser dilemman. Svaren är inte givna eller självklara, ofta har de en komplexitet där det ”beror på”. Förutsättningarna skiljer sig åt beroende på olika situationer och är allt som oftast oförutsägbara.\n\n\n\n\n\nInledning - Modul 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI idag är redan bättre än människor på många uppgifter, inte sällan sådana som man ofta kopplar samman med hög intelligens, exempelvis i spel som schack eller Go.\nDet är ändå väldigt långt kvar tills tekniken kan utföra mycket av sådant som de flesta människor klarar med liten eller ingen speciell träning alls, som till exempel att förstå ett skämt eller att fungera på ett mänskligt sätt i ett socialt samspel. Det här beror på att det vi kallar sunt förnuft.\n\n\n\n\n\nHur vi löser en uppgift? - Modul 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNär du som yrkesmänniska ställs inför en uppgift där det krävs ansvar för beslut, handling och agerande, använder du dig inte bara av informationen du får för stunden om den aktuella situationen och själva uppgiften.\nDu använder också dina erfarenheter och din helhetsförståelse om den kontext som uppgiften har. Frågeställningar som innefattar moral och etik ställer yrkeskunskapen på sin spets.\n\n\n\n\n\nVad är AI bra på? - Modul 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtt AI-system är bra på det komplicerade och lär sig exempelvis lätt att spela schack eller känna igen mönster genom att bearbeta många exempel på kort tid – men det krävs ofta många, och väl utvalda exempel.\nEtt barn lär sig, bara efter en handfull exempel, en sådan sak som att känna igen en hund. Människan är bra på det komplexa och att göra analogier med erfarenheter från exempel från helt andra områden. Människan har lättare att hantera det oväntade, det avvikande, och att förstå kontexten.\n\n\n\n\n\nHur utvecklar man yrkeskunnande? - Modul 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDen erfarna bilföraren utvecklar en förmåga som gör att man inte tänker på hur man hanterar själva bilen – som att ha rätt växel.\nBilföraren utvecklar också blicken för trafiksituationer och värderar kontinuerligt helhetssituationer. Man gör ständigt omedvetna val och agerar utan att tänka. På samma sätt utvecklas också vårt yrkeskunnande.\n\n\n\n\n\nHur ska vi agera? - Modul 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVi behöver etablera en gemensam grundläggande förståelse för området där vi verkar – för yrkeskunskapen och den praxis som etablerats inom yrkesområdet i stort.\nEn fördjupad förståelse av de yrkesutmaningar vi försöker bemästra är en förutsättning för att kunna arbeta med AI-transformationen genom att skapa effektiva användningsfall.

I den här introduktionen får du en grundläggande förståelse av AI genom en serie inspelade seminarier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduktion\nModul 1\nKursen vänder sig till yrkeserfarna i organisationer där artificiell intelligens (AI) har blivit, eller är på väg att bli, en del av verksamheten.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nInledning\nModul 2\nAI idag är redan bättre än människor på många uppgifter, inte sällan sådana som man ofta kopplar samman med hög intelligens, exempelvis i spel som schack eller Go.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHur vi löser en uppgift?\nModul 3\nNär du som yrkesmänniska ställs inför en uppgift använder du dig inte bara av informationen du får för stunden utan din helhetsförståelse\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVad är AI bra på?\nModul 4\nEtt AI-system är bra på det komplicerade och lär sig exempelvis lätt att spela schack men det krävs ofta många, och väl utvalda exempel.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHur utvecklar man yrkeskunnande?\nModul 5\nDen erfarna bilföraren utvecklar en förmåga som gör att man inte tänker på hur man hanterar själva bilen. På samma sätt utvecklas också vårt yrkeskunnande.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHur ska vi agera?\nModul 6\nVi behöver etablera en gemensam grundläggande förståelse för området där vi verkar – för yrkeskunskapen och den praxis som etablerats inom yrkesområdet i stort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduktion - Modul 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKursen vänder sig till yrkeserfarna i organisationer där artificiell intelligens (AI) har blivit, eller är på väg att bli, en del av verksamheten.\nVi kommer att belysa AI från ett kunskapsperspektiv och behandla vardagsfrågor inom yrket där vi ser dilemman. Svaren är inte givna eller självklara, ofta har de en komplexitet där det ”beror på”. Förutsättningarna skiljer sig åt beroende på olika situationer och är allt som oftast oförutsägbara.\n\n\n\n\n\nInledning - Modul 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI idag är redan bättre än människor på många uppgifter, inte sällan sådana som man ofta kopplar samman med hög intelligens, exempelvis i spel som schack eller Go.\nDet är ändå väldigt långt kvar tills tekniken kan utföra mycket av sådant som de flesta människor klarar med liten eller ingen speciell träning alls, som till exempel att förstå ett skämt eller att fungera på ett mänskligt sätt i ett socialt samspel. Det här beror på att det vi kallar sunt förnuft.\n\n\n\n\n\nHur vi löser en uppgift? - Modul 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNär du som yrkesmänniska ställs inför en uppgift där det krävs ansvar för beslut, handling och agerande, använder du dig inte bara av informationen du får för stunden om den aktuella situationen och själva uppgiften.\nDu använder också dina erfarenheter och din helhetsförståelse om den kontext som uppgiften har. Frågeställningar som innefattar moral och etik ställer yrkeskunskapen på sin spets.\n\n\n\n\n\nVad är AI bra på? - Modul 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtt AI-system är bra på det komplicerade och lär sig exempelvis lätt att spela schack eller känna igen mönster genom att bearbeta många exempel på kort tid – men det krävs ofta många, och väl utvalda exempel.\nEtt barn lär sig, bara efter en handfull exempel, en sådan sak som att känna igen en hund. Människan är bra på det komplexa och att göra analogier med erfarenheter från exempel från helt andra områden. Människan har lättare att hantera det oväntade, det avvikande, och att förstå kontexten.\n\n\n\n\n\nHur utvecklar man yrkeskunnande? - Modul 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDen erfarna bilföraren utvecklar en förmåga som gör att man inte tänker på hur man hanterar själva bilen – som att ha rätt växel.\nBilföraren utvecklar också blicken för trafiksituationer och värderar kontinuerligt helhetssituationer. Man gör ständigt omedvetna val och agerar utan att tänka. På samma sätt utvecklas också vårt yrkeskunnande.\n\n\n\n\n\nHur ska vi agera? - Modul 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVi behöver etablera en gemensam grundläggande förståelse för området där vi verkar – för yrkeskunskapen och den praxis som etablerats inom yrkesområdet i stort.\nEn fördjupad förståelse av de yrkesutmaningar vi försöker bemästra är en förutsättning för att kunna arbeta med AI-transformationen genom att skapa effektiva användningsfall. Det är också en förutsättning för att kunna göra den riskanalys av de nya arbetssätt som inkluderar AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNästa\nFöregående\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFör mer information, kontakta\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Raquel Broman\n\n\nHead of Training\nraquel.broman@ai.se\n+46 (0)76 883 86 74\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Niclas Fock\n\n\nSenior Advisor\nniclas.fock@ai.se\n+46 (0)72-224 22 84"}

However, it is challenging for individual actors to adapt and deploy models for their organizational needs due to difficulties in attracting skilled staff, poor data readiness, and acquiring suitable hardware. \nAI Sweden believes that foundational models constitute a promising alternative to tackle these challenges. They have the potential to transform traditional ways of solving text processing needs. \nProject purpose\nThis project tests the hypothesis that foundational models can reduce the threshold for using advanced language models to solve text-processing tasks in the private and public sectors. \nIt investigates the possibility of using a large-scale Swedish generative language model to create a general solution for text-processing tasks that can be used by many different stakeholders. The project is based on the large-scale generative language model GPT-SW3, which AI Sweden is developing in collaboration with RISE, WASP WARA Media & Language and NVIDIA. The project will make GPT-SW3 available via an API and user-friendly web-based interface, develop solutions for text processing tasks (e.g. through prompting and p-tuning), and validate the use of the model across various use cases, with clear need owners from the public sector, industry, and academia.\nThe key innovations of the project are partly the API and the web-based interface for the model, and partly the validation of using the model to solve a large number of different text-processing tasks. \nHow? \nThe project brings together stakeholders from the public sector, industry, and academia. AI Sweden and RISE will develop the API solution as the first step of the project. In the next step, the project focuses on different use cases in the stakeholders’ organizations. \nThese use cases focus on text processing applications such as text generation and summarization, categorization, and information extraction. \nThe work will take place iteratively: AI Sweden and RISE validate and improve the API solution with the help of results from the various use cases. The stakeholders are responsible for their respective use cases with the support of AI Sweden and RISE.\nExpected outcomes\nIf this project succeeds it will drastically reduce the threshold for using advanced language models to solve text-processing tasks. This will lead to a disruptive change and acceleration in the use of AI-driven Swedish language technology. Stakeholders will no longer need to invest in costly processes of collecting training data for their specific needs, nor will they have to purchase and operate expensive hardware resources. The results and resources produced within this project will be applicable in virtually all sectors and industries.

Dock är det utmanande för enskilda aktörer att anpassa och implementera modeller för sina organisatoriska behov på grund av svårigheter att attrahera kvalificerad personal, dålig dataförberedelse och att skaffa lämplig hårdvara.\nAI Sweden tror att grundläggande modeller utgör ett lovande alternativ för att ta itu med dessa utmaningar. De har potentialen att förändra traditionella sätt att lösa textbearbetningsbehov.\nProjektets syfte\nDetta projekt testar hypotesen att grundläggande modeller kan sänka tröskeln för att använda avancerade språkmodeller för att lösa textbearbetningsuppgifter inom privat och offentlig sektor.\nDet undersöker möjligheten att använda en storskalig svensk generativ språkmodell för att skapa en generell lösning för textbearbetningsuppgifter som kan användas av många olika intressenter. Projektet bygger på den storskaliga generativa språkmodellen GPT-SW3, som AI Sweden utvecklar i samarbete med RISE, WASP WARA Media & Language och NVIDIA. Projektet kommer att göra GPT-SW3 tillgänglig via ett API och ett användarvänligt webbaserat gränssnitt, utveckla lösningar för textbearbetningsuppgifter (t.ex. genom uppmaningar och p-tuning), och validera användningen av modellen i olika användarfall, med tydliga ägare från offentlig sektor, näringsliv och akademi.\nProjektets nyckelinnovationer är dels API:t och det webbaserade gränssnittet för modellen, och dels valideringen av att använda modellen för att lösa ett stort antal olika textbearbetningsuppgifter.\nHur?\nProjektet samlar intressenter från offentlig sektor, näringsliv och akademi. AI Sweden och RISE kommer att utveckla API-lösningen som det första steget i projektet. I nästa steg fokuserar projektet på olika användningsfall i intressenternas organisationer.\nDessa användningsfall fokuserar på textbearbetningsapplikationer som textgenerering och sammanfattning, kategorisering och informationsextraktion.\nArbetet kommer att ske iterativt: AI Sweden och RISE validerar och förbättrar API-lösningen med hjälp av resultat från de olika användarfallen. Intressenterna ansvarar för sina respektive användarfall med stöd av AI Sweden och RISE.\nFörväntade resultat\nOm detta projekt lyckas kommer det att drastiskt sänka tröskeln för att använda avancerade språkmodeller för att lösa textbearbetningsuppgifter. Detta kommer att leda till en disruptiv förändring och acceleration i användningen av AI-driven svensk språkteknologi. Intressenterna kommer inte längre att behöva investera i kostsamma processer för att samla in träningsdata för sina specifika behov, och de kommer inte heller att behöva köpa och driva dyra hårdvaruresurser. Resultaten och resurserna som produceras inom detta projekt kommer att vara tillämpliga inom praktiskt taget alla sektorer och industrier.

The first version of an evaluation framework for Swedish language models has now been released with a set of language understanding tasks. Being able to evaluate the models within parameters such as performance and bias is key in enabling NLP applications more broadly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation of the SuperLIM project\nHear the presentation by Aleksandrs Berdicevskis, University of Gothenburg, at the workshop 'Applied Swedish NLP' at SLTC, in November 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nThe SuperLim project forms the basis of a national testbed for Swedish language models by creating a Swedish version of (Super)GLUE. By providing a standardized collection of benchmarking tests for Swedish language models, the collaboration supports the national responsibility of facilitating the development of trustworthy and robust NLP applications.\nThe benchmarking tests provide an essential step in enabling the implementation of quality NLP applications on a broad scale in Sweden. The transferability of the results from ongoing initiatives and projects depends largely on such an infrastructure.\nProject goal\nThe goal of the project is to start forming a national evaluation framework. The project consists of data collection as well as annotation of data. \n\nResults\nFind the pre-release version of SuperLim at Språkbanken.\nBackground\nThe goal is to enable applied solutions using NLP on a broad, national level. Swedish Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now undergoing a transformative breakthrough with the development of large-scale Swedish language models. The ongoing initiatives attempting to make Swedish language models available, and to increase the accessibility to Swedish language data, are important steps toward this goal\nEach company, university, and public authority will be able to make use of this groundwork when applying models specifically trained for assignments identified within their own organization. This will have a positive impact on efficiency in many different kinds of professions. For example, healthcare personnel can focus on providing care instead of administration.\nA precondition for achieving this is to have a common way of describing the quality of the language models and how they work. When developing or implementing applications that are based on Swedish language models, it is of great importance to be able to understand the qualities of both the underlying algorithms as well as the application itself. The performance of a language model is not only about how well it has been trained to understand and perform its specified task. The data it is trained on and how it affects the model is at least as important for our understanding of the results that we receive when applying the models. \nTo increase the explainability of language models and what they actually do, there are standard benchmarking tests for describing a range of qualities of language models provided in the collections GLUE/SuperGLUE. GLUE - General Language Understanding Evaluation -  is a set of language understanding tasks, that enable the evaluation of language models with regards to both performance and bias. Semantic similarity, inherent bias and prejudices, and word in context are examples of tests that can be found on the platform. However, these tests are not adjusted for Swedish language models. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\nThe project is a collaboration between Språkbanken Text at Gothenburg University, National Library of Sweden, RISE and AI Sweden.

Genom att tillhandahålla en standardiserad samling av benchmarkingtester för svenska språkmodeller, stöder samarbetet det nationella ansvaret att underlätta utvecklingen av pålitliga och robusta NLP-applikationer.\nBenchmarkingtesterna utgör ett väsentligt steg i möjliggörandet av implementeringen av kvalitativa NLP-applikationer i stor skala i Sverige. Överförbarheten av resultaten från pågående initiativ och projekt beror i stor utsträckning på en sådan infrastruktur.\n\nProjektets mål\nMålet med projektet är att börja skapa ett nationellt utvärderingsramverk. Projektet består av datainsamling samt annotering av data.\n\nResultat\nHitta förhandsversionen av SuperLim på Språkbanken.\n\nBakgrund\nMålet är att möjliggöra tillämpade lösningar med NLP på en bred, nationell nivå. Svensk Natural Language Processing (NLP) genomgår nu en omvandlande genombrott med utvecklingen av storskaliga svenska språkmodeller. De pågående initiativen för att göra svenska språkmodeller tillgängliga, och för att öka tillgängligheten till svenska språkdata, är viktiga steg mot detta mål.\nVarje företag, universitet och offentlig myndighet kommer att kunna dra nytta av detta grundarbete när de tillämpar modeller som specifikt tränats för uppdrag som identifierats inom sin egen organisation. Detta kommer att ha en positiv inverkan på effektiviteten i många olika typer av yrken. Till exempel kan vårdpersonal fokusera på att ge vård istället för administration.\nEn förutsättning för att uppnå detta är att ha ett gemensamt sätt att beskriva kvaliteten på språkmodellerna och hur de fungerar. När man utvecklar eller implementerar applikationer som är baserade på svenska språkmodeller, är det av stor vikt att kunna förstå kvaliteterna hos både de underliggande algoritmerna samt applikationen själv. Prestandan för en språkmodell handlar inte bara om hur väl den har tränats för att förstå och utföra sin angivna uppgift. De data den tränas på och hur det påverkar modellen är minst lika viktigt för vår förståelse av de resultat vi får när vi tillämpar modellerna.\nFör att öka förklarbarheten hos språkmodeller och vad de faktiskt gör, finns det standardiserade benchmarkingtester för att beskriva en rad kvaliteter hos språkmodeller som finns i samlingarna GLUE/SuperGLUE. GLUE - General Language Understanding Evaluation - är en uppsättning av uppgifter för språkförståelse, som möjliggör utvärdering av språkmodeller med avseende på både prestanda och bias.

One challenge often arising in the analysis of satellite data is that of cloud occlusion. Depending on the time of the year and the location of the Area of Interest (AoI) clouds can fully or partially cover the image and hamper the analysis. There are, however, many methods available for the estimation of missing data. \nIn order to tackle this challenge and enable the full potential of satellite data, The Swedish Space Data Lab together with Arctic Business Incubator and Innovatum Startup invited to a 24-hour hackathon over the weekend of February 21-22. At this time, close to 100 developers, data science specialists, and tech-savvy students gathered at two locations - Luleå and Gothenburg - to figure out how.\n\nAn intensive 24-hour challenge\nThe teams were given two assignments; \n1,  Use the Swedish satellite data (provided through ODC) to train a model that is able to estimate certain statistics for an occluded area based on the information from the surrounding area, as reliably and accurately as possible. \n2,  Develop a viable business case for the solution developed or from techniques utilised to develop the solution.\nTo solve this challenge, the participants got access to the satellite data via the OpenDataCube(ODC) and the satellite data collected in the International Copernicus program.\nIn addition to the honor, the winning team received SEK 12,000 and an optional coaching session to further develop the business case for the developed solution with ABI or Innovatum Startup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the Space Data Hackathon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\nThe Space Data Hackathon was arranged over the weekend of 21-22 February 2020 at two different locations, The Techno Creatives in Gothenburg, and Arctic Business in Luleå.

It is indispensable for weather forecasts and monitoring the climate, among other things, but it is also extremely important for forestry, agriculture and other fields in which up-to-date information about vegetation and the land surface is needed.\nPurpose\nThe Swedish Space Data Lab (former National Space Data Lab) will be a national knowledge and data hub for Swedish authorities' work on earth observation data and for the development of AI-based analysis of data, generated in space systems. The purpose is to increase the use of data from space for the development of society and industry and for the benefit of the globe. The goal is to get data, technology and methodology in place to systematically develop services and applications that use space data in the data lab.\nThrough the Space Data Lab, we create a national infrastructure for the exploitation of space data in order to increase the possibilities of developing smart and effective AI solutions for everything from storage of space data to how you manage constellations of satellites in orbit.\nThe users of the data lab will be primarily public authorities with responsibility for civil, environmental and natural resources.\nA national resource for Satellite data\nThe Space Data Lab uses the Open Data Cube (ODC) platform which is an open-source project for geospatial data analysis that organizes the data into an efficient database structure and has Python-based API for querying data. ODC support third-party tools like NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Shapely, TensorFlow, and PyTorch and allows for Space data science using popular Jupyter notebooks web-based interactive computational environment that mixes code, documentation, mathematical mark-up and images.\nThe Open Data Cube contains Copernicus data, primarily Sentinel-2 as of today but will over time facilitate Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-3 and potentially additional data sources. Sentinel-2 data samples 13 spectral bands: four bands at 10 metres, six bands at 20 metres and three bands at 60 metres spatial resolution. The satellite's high revisit frequency over Swden provides new data every 2-3 days. The data is designed to be modified and adapted by users interested in thematic areas such as:\nSpatial planning\nAgro-environmental monitoring\nWater monitoring\nForest and vegetation monitoring\nLand carbon, natural resource monitoring\nGlobal crop monitoring\nThe users of the data lab will be primarily public authorities with responsibility for civil, environmental and natural resources, but the data lab will over time be available to everything from large forestry companies to individual farmers and private persons.\nThe Space Data Lab mission\nMake space data easily accessible and contribute to innovations and applications based on space data \nMake data, processing capacity, software platforms & tools and methodology available to lower the threshold\nEnable systematic development of services and applications based on space data\nCreate new possibilities – based on a real-time, true situational awareness\nIncrease the pre-requisites for developing countries as well as technically advanced countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\nThe Swedish Space Data Lab project is partially financed by Vinnova and coordinated by AI Sweden in cooperation with the Swedish National Space Agency, RISE, and Luleå University of Technology.

At the outset of the study, we decided to make a distinction between our beneficiaries or customers who make decisions to adopt satellite data and related technologies, and users who work hands on the satellite data. The study was conducted in two phases; phase 1 to understand our beneficiaries, followed by phase 2 to understand the users. \nThe first phase was designed as a persona development study, by reaching out to our reference group members and pilot leaders and conducting 10 in-depth interviews that informed our personas. A common representation of personas is using the resume format, but it is important to note that they represent beneficiary attributes and behaviors rather than job descriptions (indeed, they may both overlap).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAB Persona\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPDF, 226.61 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tED Persona\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPDF, 216.79 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData cube for climate adoption - Lake Vänern\nThis pilot has focused on the state of Lake Vänern with respect to water levels, vegetation, and green regeneration. As increasing numbers of open beach areas are becoming overgrown with small trees and bushes, we need to monitor how fast and where overgrowth is becoming a problem in order to identify the locations that need to be maintained.\nBy using the satellite data from the data cube, the pilot can show how the changes occur over time. Combined with machine learning it is possible to train the application in how to recognize areas that will soon become overgrown.\nWorking group: Västra Götalands länstyrelse, Swedish National Space Agency, Rise and Luleå University of Technology.

This is essential in view of the fact that the number of days with low ground humidity and a consequential high risk of fires is likely to increase in the future because of climate change.\nThe pilot that has been developed aims to identify potential areas where there is a risk of fires and, for example, announce outdoor grilling bans in good time, and increase water reserve reservoirs. It also allows us to track the damage that is caused by fires. The primary users of the application will be Västmanland County administrative board and insurance companies as a basis for customer risk assessment.\nWorking group:  Rise and Västmanland county administrative board. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Space Lab\n\n\nEdge learning has the potential to revolutionize the development of AI for space applications and AI...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Swedish Space Data Lab 2.0\n\n\nThe National Space Data Lab 2.0 (SDL2.0) is a collaborative project led by AI Sweden, RISE, Luleå...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Φ-lab@Sweden on Edge Learning in Space\n\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) and AI Sweden have signed a letter of intent to establish a space...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Vinutha Magal Shreenath\n\n\nSenior Data Scientist\nvinutha@ai.se\n+46 (0)73-152 10 98\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Chiara Ceccobello\n\n\nData Scientist\nchiara.ceccobello@ai.se"}

Det är oumbärligt för väderprognoser och övervakning av klimatet, bland annat, men det är också extremt viktigt för skogsbruk, jordbruk och andra områden där aktuell information om vegetation och markytan behövs.\nSyfte\nSwedish Space Data Lab (tidigare National Space Data Lab) kommer att vara ett nationellt kunskaps- och datacentrum för svenska myndigheters arbete med jordobservationsdata och för utvecklingen av AI-baserad analys av data, genererade i rymdsystem. Syftet är att öka användningen av data från rymden för samhällets och industrins utveckling och för jordens bästa. Målet är att få data, teknik och metodik på plats för att systematiskt utveckla tjänster och applikationer som använder rymddata i datalabbet.\nGenom Space Data Lab skapar vi en nationell infrastruktur för användning av rymddata för att öka möjligheterna att utveckla smarta och effektiva AI-lösningar för allt från lagring av rymddata till hur du hanterar konstellationer av satelliter i omloppsbana.\nAnvändarna av datalabbet kommer främst att vara offentliga myndigheter med ansvar för civila, miljömässiga och naturresurser.\nEn nationell resurs för satellitdata\nSpace Data Lab använder Open Data Cube (ODC) plattformen som är ett open-source projekt för geospatial dataanalys som organiserar datat i en effektiv databasstruktur och har ett Python-baserat API för dataförfrågningar.

I början av studien bestämde vi oss för att skilja på våra förmånstagare eller kunder som fattar beslut om att anta satellitdata och relaterade teknologier, och användare som arbetar praktiskt med satellitdata. Studien genomfördes i två faser; fas 1 för att förstå våra förmånstagare, följt av fas 2 för att förstå användarna. \nDen första fasen utformades som en studie för utveckling av personas, genom att nå ut till våra referensgruppsmedlemmar och pilotledare och genomföra 10 djupintervjuer som informerade våra personas. En vanlig representation av personas är att använda CV-formatet, men det är viktigt att notera att de representerar förmånstagares attribut och beteenden snarare än jobbeskrivningar (de kan faktiskt överlappa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAB Persona\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPDF, 226.61 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tED Persona\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPDF, 216.79 KB\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatakub för klimatanpassning - Vänern\nDenna pilot har fokuserat på tillståndet i Vänern med avseende på vattennivåer, vegetation och grönt återväxt.

Detta är väsentligt med tanke på att antalet dagar med låg markfuktighet och därmed hög risk för bränder sannolikt kommer att öka i framtiden på grund av klimatförändringar.\nPiloten som har utvecklats syftar till att identifiera potentiella områden där det finns risk för bränder och till exempel annonsera grillförbud i god tid, och öka vattenreservreservoarerna. Den tillåter oss också att spåra den skada som orsakas av bränder.

A notable use case that highlights this need is presented by the Forestry Authority in Sweden (Skogsstyrelsen). To monitor the state and size of forested areas in Sweden over time, it is necessary to obtain Earth observations of the same region spanning several months.\nHowever, due to the lack of high accuracy in classifying cloudy versus clear-sky images, a significant amount of time and resources are wasted downloading corrupted images and manually inspecting individual images one by one. While this may appear as a specific case, we believe that accurate cloud mask detection can benefit numerous other stakeholders who are currently facing similar limitations.\nOur approach involves training AI-based models using synthetic data from SMHI to estimate the cloud optical thickness. We are currently in the process of validating these models using a dataset from the Forestry Authority in Sweden and other available datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\nThe results were presented with a poster contribution at the EUMETSAT conference in Malmö in September and in a paper.

Projektet syftar till att föra samman industri, akademi och offentlig sektor för att utveckla nya produkter, tjänster och kunskap baserat på användningen av rymddata.\nSom huvudfokus för SDL 2.0 utvecklar vi för närvarande en molnmaskmodell med hjälp av maskininlärningsalgoritmer för att förbättra Scene Classification Layer (SCL) som tillhandahålls av ESA i Sentinel-2-dataprodukten L2A.\nUtmaning\nDetektering av tunna moln är en välkänd utmaning och ett aktivt forskningsområde inom jordobservationssamhället (se exempelvis Skakun et al., 2022). Noggrann identifiering av tunna moln är avgörande för olika aktörer som arbetar med rymddata, inte bara för atmosfärstudier, utan också för att effektivt avvisa korrumperade bilder och minska nedladdnings- och bearbetningstiden för onödigt stora datasegment. Ett påtagligt användningsområde som belyser detta behov presenteras av Skogsstyrelsen i Sverige. För att övervaka tillståndet och storleken på skogsbeklädda områden i Sverige över tid krävs jordobservationer av samma region som sträcker sig över flera månader.\nEmellertid, på grund av bristen på hög noggrannhet vid klassificering av molniga kontra klarhimmelbilder, slösas en betydande mängd tid och resurser bort på att ladda ner korrumperade bilder och manuellt inspektera individuella bilder en efter en. Även om detta kan verka som ett specifikt fall, tror vi att noggrann detektion av molnmask kan gynna många andra intressenter som för närvarande står inför liknande begränsningar.\nVårt tillvägagångssätt innebär att träna AI-baserade modeller med hjälp av syntetiska data från SMHI för att uppskatta molnens optiska tjocklek.

Allt vi gjorde var kostnadsfritt, mot ett intyg om försumbart stöd. Inga förkunskaper om AI behövdes.\nAllt började med samtal och efterföljande möten hos företagen, där vi försökte hitta vad som passade deras verksamhet. Kanske var det en inspirationsföreläsning för företagsledningen/styrelsen för att avdramatisera vad AI är och fokusera på hur de kunde använda tekniken ur ett strategiskt perspektiv för att skapa affärsvärde. Efter det genomförde vi en mognadsmätning som skulle ses som ett avstamp för att skapa medvetenhet, kommunikation och ge underlag till en färdplan framåt. Vi erbjöd även möjligheten till en idéworkshop där företagen kunde lära sig metoder och verktyg/mallar för att hitta och beskriva sina affärskapande användningsfall.\n \nLär dig mer om AI\nHär har vi samlat material som du kan ta del av i egen takt.

Up-and-coming technologies will bring challenges not yet thought of. \nPurpose\nA newly formed network, Digital Forensics Sweden, is seeking to address the challenges outlined above. They are looking at an array of actions across education, cooperation in technology development, research, and innovation and intend to create a national competence center in Östergötland to be the focal point of the developing field of digital forensics. AI Sweden is collaborating with Digital Forensics Sweden to explore in a pre-study phase how AI can be used in digital forensics. \nAI is eminently suited to many security tasks such as spotting suspicious computer behavior quickly and at scale. AI tools can extract patterns, and flag specific chains of events from large swathes of data. Moreover, multimodal AI (combining e.g. face, voice, and movement patterns) can provide much more accurate identification. \nBy facilitating cooperation between need owners, researchers, service & product providers, and the societal judiciary, it will be possible to address common challenges and develop secure products and services.

The base platform can be used to quickly establish new data labs where different actors can collaborate and share knowledge.\nChallenges\nThe rapid digitalization of society means that the data ecosystem is continuously expanding with new data sources. To be able to take advantage of the new data sources, support for the processing and analysis of data is needed. The data ecosystem naturally transcends both organizational and geographical boundaries. As a result, we need to adapt where and how data is analyzed so that it is based on available data while addressing societal challenges. Increasingly, collaborations regarding data processing and analysis will involve several actors from both the public and private sectors. Meanwhile, issues regarding confidentiality, security, data quality, and ethics are becoming increasingly important as the amount of data increases.\nPurpose\nThe main focus of the base platform is to support the common need for processing and analysis including AI and machine learning methods. The base platform will be made available through container technology to increase the adjustability of solutions and enable more organizations, with different infrastructural and confidentiality conditions, to create data labs. Along with support for processing and analysis, the base platform focuses on enabling the creation of high-quality, reliable analyses and models. \nThe project will address the following questions:\nHow can the establishment of new data labs be simplified?\nIn what ways can data labs support the quality and security of data analysis?\nHow can we enable several actors to collaborate in a data lab?\nHow can competence and experience, best practices, ready-made machine learning models, checklists, etc. be packaged and made available when new data labs are created?\nExpected outcomes\nSimplify the processing and analysis of data for organizations.\nSupport initiatives that aim to process and analyze open datasets that are available through, e.g., dataportal.se.\nSupport processing and analysis of datasets that exist within different organizations.\nBy building on well-established, open initiatives, the project will deliver a base platform for processing and analysis that can be used as a springboard to quickly establish new data labs.

Basplattformen kommer att göras tillgänglig genom containerteknologi för att öka justerbarheten av lösningar och möjliggöra för fler organisationer, med olika infrastrukturella och konfidentiella villkor, att skapa data-labbar. Tillsammans med stöd för bearbetning och analys, fokuserar basplattformen på att möjliggöra skapandet av högkvalitativa, tillförlitliga analyser och modeller.\nProjektet kommer att behandla följande frågor:\nHur kan etableringen av nya data-labbar förenklas?\nPå vilka sätt kan data-labbar stödja kvaliteten och säkerheten i dataanalys?\nHur kan vi möjliggöra för flera aktörer att samarbeta i ett data-labb?\nHur kan kompetens och erfarenhet, bästa praxis, färdiga maskininlärningsmodeller, checklister, etc. paketeras och göras tillgängliga när nya data-labbar skapas?\nFörväntade resultat\nFörenkla bearbetning och analys av data för organisationer.\nStödja initiativ som syftar till att bearbeta och analysera öppna datamängder som finns tillgängliga genom, t.ex., dataportal.se.\nStödja bearbetning och analys av datamängder som finns inom olika organisationer.\nGenom att bygga på väletablerade, öppna initiativ kommer projektet att leverera en basplattform för bearbetning och analys som kan användas som en språngbräda för att snabbt etablera nya data-labbar. På lång sikt kan projektets resultat bli en del av den gemensamt förvaltade digitala infrastrukturen ENA, skapad av Myndigheten För Digital Förvaltning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFakta\nProjektet koordineras av Statistics Sweden, tillsammans med AI Sweden och Örebro Universitet.

It focused primarily on projects in the fields of Mobility, Healthcare, and Urban Development. DRIV delimited its scope to legal considerations within the EU.\nThe main purpose and goals of the project were to:\nIdentify the legal challenges faced by such R&I projects. What methods are necessary to address these issues? What support measures are needed? What systematic changes are required?\nDevelop methods and tools to conduct legal risk analysis based on project data assets, identifying and planning how to address the issues that need to be investigated. The method was evaluated in a number of pilot projects within data-driven innovation.\nStrengthen the general legal understanding among the target audience through DRIV's Seminar Series, in order for each project to identify and plan for its own activities and the need for additional expert advice.\nInspire an approach where legal and technical experts together address legal issues early and throughout the project. By collaborating and increasing understanding of each other's areas of expertise, different disciplines, and professional groups can learn from each other.\nMonitor developments and follow the work of new legislation such as the AI Act, Data Act, etc., which may directly impact these projects.\nResults:\nThe DRIV project brought together various stakeholders who identified legal challenges in data-driven innovation research and innovation projects. Through roundtable discussions and seminars, desirable support measures were identified, and the participant's level of knowledge increased.\nA method for identifying and managing risks in collaborative projects was developed and evaluated in three research and innovation projects.

The development of state-of-the-art Swedish language models specifically designed for use in the public sector, and techniques for utilizing them, will enable novel types of NLP applications that have the potential to revolutionize the use of NLP in the Swedish public sector. The data, infrastructure and frameworks developed in the project will also enable the development of novel types of representation learning, and will thus ensure that Swedish NLP remains at the forefront of development.\"\nThe focus of the project is initially on four use cases: machine understanding and conversational AI, semantic textual similarity, entity tagging (named entity recognition) and text classification.\nAI Sweden is responsible for coordinating and validating the data used in the project and for distributing the results and the knowledge to the reference group, external stakeholders and interested parties. Organizing workshops and events (such as hackathons) will be part of the distribution activities, as well as cooperating and sharing knowledge, experience, and results with the other NLP projects and data owners.\nBackground\nThe language models developed during the course of the project will eventually assist the authorities in sifting through, categorizing and finding the right information in large amounts of text. By using NLP to make communication more automated, there is a great benefit to society in significantly reducing costs and inefficient use of resources. Public authorities, for example, can be assisted with compiling and summarising reports or cutting normally long service queue times. When authorities need to manage large amounts of documentation, NLP will allow them to link together different text documents based on their content.

The municipalities Malmö, Helsingborg, and Lund are evaluating the UNICEF policy guidelines by applying them to existing policies, ongoing projects, and concepts.\nThe City of Helsingborg is evaluating its chatbot Laiban. Laiban is already in use in municipal day care centers, responding to children’s daily questions about meals, playtime, pick-up times, and more. It is designed to complement the teachers’ role, enabling children to develop independently. The city is exploring AI opportunities to extend the scope of the chatbot, keeping children’s rights at the core. Is it possible to use AI to develop a platform to objectively assess children’s development? Accessibility, independence, and social and environmental sustainability are key focus areas.\nThe municipality of Lund is evaluating the UNICEF policy recommendations against their existing policies. This will inform which working processes would benefit from applying AI. One of the real-time project candidates in Lund is the design of a new playground. How can AI encourage more movement and more play? Or promote inclusion, equal rights and integrity? The team is applying the principles defined in the AI for Children policy guide already in the concept development.  \nThe City of Malmö is evaluating its urban planning process to ensure that it is child-centered. How can we use AI to develop our city to better respond to the needs of the children? Children’s development, inclusion, fairness, and safety are key principles being evaluated. \nIn a parallel national pre-study, partly financed by Vinnova, AI Sweden, Lund University and Mobile Heights are engaging with relevant public and private organizations to establish a fertile ecosystem for how to promote children’s rights in AI development and policy. Using insights from the three UNICEF pilot studies, and in dialogue with cross-sector stakeholders and experts, the team is building a strong network, and a proposal for how to organize the issue on a national level by activating the AI ecosystem. How do we collaborate, and share knowledge and experience to help accelerate AI solutions that consider the perspective and needs of the child? \nAI Sweden is contributing with knowledge and expertise, as well as facilitating the evaluation process with UNICEF. \nFinal input will be presented to UNICEF during July-September 2021 and the results will be analyzed by researchers at Lund University, with findings included in future curricula. \nDuring the fall of 2021, findings and outcomes will be presented at national and global events. \nThe other pilot projects providing input to UNICEF’s policy guidelines include the Government of Rwanda, the Alan Turing Institute, UK, Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, H&M Group, Sweden, and the Honda Research Institute Japan, to name but a few.

This was the first federative, large-scale modeling of artificial neural networks for language comprehension in Sweden and one of the first examples worldwide. The potential impact is substantial as it would enable more actors to use large, existing datasets without the data ever leaving the point where it originated - thus solving pressing challenges around data sharing and privacy. The pilot could also be a first, important step towards a shared Scandinavian language model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe digital collections at the National Library are the largest and most advanced ones in existence for the Swedish language today. They are used for some of the most successful work with large language models, including the widely used Swedish language model KB-BERT. This pilot study allowed the National Library to combine its own data with text resources from other national libraries. As a first step, data from the Norwegian National Library will be included and thereafter potentially be expanded to Denmark and Finland as well as the Swedish University Libraries. Moreover, it will give other actors in Sweden the opportunity to train and benchmark large language models as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'This is a very exciting project and we actually do not know how it will work out yet. If we succeed, it will be a huge leap forward for language technology in Sweden and Scandinavia.

It is for example difficult for the National Library to share their data outside of their own organization. Federated learning allows algorithms to be sent out to the site of where the data originates to train the data there instead. As a result, the data does not leave the originating site at the library. Knowledge and insights - instead of raw data - are aggregated centrally. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'The project is a great example of the potential in combining the power of AI Sweden’s two strategic programs on Decentralized AI and Applied Language Technology.

Den potentiella påverkan är betydande eftersom den skulle möjliggöra för fler aktörer att använda stora, befintliga datamängder utan att datan någonsin lämnar den punkt där den uppstod - vilket löser brådskande utmaningar kring datadelning och integritet.

De används för några av de mest framgångsrika arbetena med stora språkmodeller, inklusive den vida använda svenska språkmodellen KB-BERT. Denna pilotstudie gjorde det möjligt för Kungliga biblioteket att kombinera sina egna data med textresurser från andra nationella bibliotek.

This could finally allow European organizations to account for GDPR and build competitive and common algorithms on each other's data.  Federated Learning is an emerging technology where a machine learning model is constructed in a decentralized way with data remaining locally under the data owners' control.\nWhen we speak about machine learning, algorithms are most often trained on centralized data. This means that the algorithm owner has to gather all the data in one place, before training the model, and can at the same time freely view the real data values. Instead, a new technology called federated machine learning, fedML, works on the basis that one distributed algorithm trains locally, i.e. decentralized, where the sensitive data is stored privately. Each locally trained algorithm is then sent back with a small model update to the orchestrating user, and aggregated to one global model, without the user having ever seen the data. \nThis technology has the potential to put Sweden in the forefront when utilizing their data where companies can build something much greater from collaborating and also finally letting Swedens different regions utilize each health care data to start making progress never seen before.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  POCs within the testbed\n\n\nFederated Mortality Prediction Region Halland, together with Halmstad University, has devised an...\n\n\n\n  Result Page - Federated Learning Testbed Project\n\n\nThe Vinnova-financed Federated Learning Testbed project has been running from August 2020 till June...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederated Learning Testbed: Results sharing session\nWatch the FedML Result Session - May 27, 2021"}

Federerad maskininlärning har löftet om att möjliggöra för olika organisationer att dela tillgång till deras data, utan att den andra parten ser de faktiska datat. Detta kan äntligen tillåta europeiska organisationer att beakta GDPR och bygga konkurrenskraftiga och gemensamma algoritmer på varandras data. Federerad inlärning är en framväxande teknik där en maskininlärningsmodell konstrueras på ett decentraliserat sätt med data som förblir lokalt under datägarnas kontroll.\nNär vi talar om maskininlärning, tränas algoritmer oftast på centraliserade data. Det innebär att algoritmens ägare måste samla all data på ett ställe, innan modellen tränas, och kan samtidigt fritt titta på de verkliga datavärdena. Istället fungerar en ny teknik kallad Federerad maskininlärning, fedML, på basisen att en distribuerad algoritm tränas lokalt, dvs decentraliserat, där den känsliga datan lagras privat. Varje lokalt tränad algoritm skickas sedan tillbaka med en liten modelluppdatering till den orkestrerande användaren, och aggregeras till en global modell, utan att användaren någonsin har sett datat.\nDenna teknik har potential att sätta Sverige i framkant när det gäller att utnyttja sina data där företag kan bygga något mycket större genom att samarbeta och även äntligen låta Sveriges olika regioner utnyttja varje sjukvårdsdatas för att börja göra framsteg som aldrig tidigare skådats.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  Resultatsida - Testbädd för Federerad Inlärning\n\n\nDet Vinnova-finansierade projektet Testbädd för Federerad Inlärning har pågått från augusti 2020...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFedererad Makininlärning Testbädd: Resultatsession\nSe FedML resultatsession - 27 may, 2021"}

NLP makes the meaning contained within data more accessible to us in many different contexts. These NLP-based applications can assist us in extracting the relevant information based on the context, by doing summaries, simulations, interpretations, and much more from large amounts of language data. \nThe algorithms that form the basis of these applications are called language models. Development of Swedish-specific language models relies to a large extent on data specifically written (or spoken) in Swedish. Swedish is a small language and global players rarely have an interest in producing annotated data sets for Swedish. The development of language models in Swedish is important to maintain linguistic diversity and promote innovation in the field of NLP in Sweden, which will benefit a wide array of organisations in the academic world, industry and the public sector.\nPurpose\nThe Swedish Language Data Lab is a project funded by Vinnova and coordinated by AI Sweden. It is an explorative project, based on collaboration between leading players in the field of NLP and stakeholders from public sector and academia. The aim of the project is to collect the know-how and connected challenges of some of the important steps in the NLP implementation process - from identifying the needs to evaluating trained language models. The work is divided into several areas with the following goals: \nDevelop and make available trained Swedish language models; a NER model and two sentiment analysis models.\nProduce a technical, legal, and ethical framework for processing and facilitating accessibility to Swedish language data sets.\nAnalyse text and models from the perspective of spoken dialogue.\nPerform requirement analysis and data harvesting in the public sector.\nConduct preliminary studies for NLP specifically developed for the medical and legal domains.\nDevelop a platform for training models without seeing the actual data. \nProject goal\nThe overall goal of the project is to create a national knowledge hub within NLP that will accelerate innovation, research, and applications in this area. The project forms part of Vinnova’s “Data-driven innovation” funding programme which aims to “increase the level of expertise in reusing data in innovations in Sweden”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\nThe project is coordinated by AI Sweden. Recorded Future, Gavagai, and Talkamatic provide language technology expertise, while Språkbanken, the language research unit at the University of Gothenburg, and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKR) are stakeholders and owners of data.

NLP gör data mer tillgängligt för oss i många olika sammanhang. Dessa NLP-baserade applikationer kan hjälpa oss att utvinna relevant information baserat på sammanhanget, genom att göra sammanfattningar, simuleringar, tolkningar och mycket mer från stora mängder språkdata.\nAlgoritmerna som utgör grunden för dessa applikationer kallas språkmodeller. Utvecklingen av svensk-specifika språkmodeller beror till stor del på data som är specifikt skrivet (eller talat) på svenska. Svenska är ett litet språk och globala aktörer har sällan något intresse av att producera annoterade datauppsättningar för svenska. Utvecklingen av språkmodeller på svenska är viktig för att upprätthålla språklig mångfald och främja innovation inom området NLP i Sverige, vilket kommer att gynna en mängd organisationer inom akademiska världen, industrin och den offentliga sektorn.\nSyfte\nSvenska Språkdata Labbet är ett projekt finansierat av Vinnova och koordinerat av AI Sweden. Det är ett utforskande projekt, baserat på samarbete mellan ledande aktörer inom NLP och intressenter från offentlig sektor och akademi. Syftet med projektet är att samla kunskap och utmaningar med några av de viktiga stegen i NLP-implementeringsprocessen - från att identifiera behoven till att utvärdera utbildade språkmodeller. Arbetet är uppdelat i flera områden med följande mål:\nUtveckla och tillgängliggöra utbildade svenska språkmodeller; en NER-modell och två sentimentanalysmodeller.\nSkapa ett tekniskt, lagligt och etiskt ramverk för bearbetning och underlättande av tillgänglighet till svenska språkdatauppsättningar.\nAnalysera text och modeller ur perspektivet av talad dialog.\nUtföra kravanalys och datainsamling i den offentliga sektorn.\nGenomföra förstudier för NLP specifikt utvecklat för medicinska och juridiska domäner.\nUtveckla en plattform för att utbilda modeller utan att se de faktiska datat.\nProjektets mål\nDet övergripande målet med projektet är att skapa en nationell kunskapsnod inom NLP som kommer att accelerera innovation, forskning och applikationer inom detta område.

The goal is to further develop individualized treatment and improve health care by building a nationwide, open-access, population-based cohort.\nSCAPIS is a unique study that has recruited and investigated 30,000 men and women aged 50 to 64 years with detailed imaging and functional analyses of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. \nThe main funder of SCAPIS is the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation with considerable support from Knut and Alice Wallenbergs Foundation, Vinnova, The Swedish Research Council and the participating Universities and University Hospitals.\n \nThere is a significant need for secure access to high-quality medical data and powerful computing resources to allow for the research and development of AI solutions which will lead to more individualized care, improved diagnostics, and more predictive measures. SCAPIS is a unique Swedish population study funded by the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation which has evaluated the condition of the hearts and lungs of 30,000 randomly selected men and women aged between 50 and 64. The objective of the SCAPIS study is to be able to identify individual risks of, for example, stroke, COPD, sudden cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and other heart diseases. The aim is to acquire much greater knowledge of the origins of the disease in order to be able to prevent it before it occurs.\nThe SCAPIS database contains a set of data that is the only one of its kind in the world. In Sweden, there are several other collections of high-quality medical data where AI can give a better understanding of disease and, importantly, identify possible predictive and preventive measures.\nThe problem is that medical data is sensitive by its very nature. It is often essential to follow up with individual patients in the future, which means that data cannot always be anonymized. Therefore, it must be possible to carry out the research without putting personal integrity at risk. In this area, we are looking at two different solutions. One is a secure, enclosed environment for AI development and the other involves the generation of synthetic data that corresponds to the SCAPIS images without being actual images.

Målet är att ytterligare utveckla individualiserad behandling och förbättra hälso- och sjukvården genom att bygga en nationell, öppen tillgång, populationsbaserad kohort.\nSCAPIS är en unik studie som har rekryterat och undersökt 30 000 män och kvinnor i åldrarna 50 till 64 år med detaljerade bild- och funktionsanalyser av det kardiovaskulära och pulmonära systemen.\nHuvudfinansiären av SCAPIS är Svenska Hjärt-Lungfonden med betydande stöd från Knut och Alice Wallenbergs stiftelse, Vinnova, Vetenskapsrådet och de deltagande universiteten och universitetssjukhusen.\n \nDet finns ett betydande behov av säker tillgång till högkvalitativa medicinska data och kraftfulla databehandlingsresurser för att möjliggöra forskning och utveckling av AI-lösningar som kommer att leda till mer individualiserad vård, förbättrade diagnostiska metoder och mer förebyggande åtgärder. SCAPIS är en unik svensk populationsstudie finansierad av Svenska Hjärt-Lungfonden som har utvärderat tillståndet hos hjärtan och lungor hos 30 000 slumpmässigt utvalda män och kvinnor i åldrarna mellan 50 och 64. Syftet med SCAPIS studien är att kunna identifiera individuella risker för till exempel stroke, COPD, plötslig hjärtstopp, hjärtinfarkt och andra hjärtsjukdomar. Målet är att förvärva mycket större kunskap om sjukdomens ursprung för att kunna förebygga den innan den inträffar.\nSCAPIS databas innehåller en datamängd som är den enda i sitt slag i världen. I Sverige finns flera andra samlingar av högkvalitativa medicinska data där AI kan ge en bättre förståelse för sjukdom och, viktigt nog, identifiera möjliga förebyggande och förutsägande åtgärder.\nProblemet är att medicinska data är känsliga till sin natur. Det är ofta nödvändigt att följa upp individuella patienter i framtiden, vilket innebär att data inte alltid kan anonymiseras. Därför måste det vara möjligt att genomföra forskningen utan att sätta den personliga integriteten på spel. Inom detta område tittar vi på två olika lösningar. Den ena är en säker, innesluten miljö för AI-utveckling och den andra innebär generering av syntetiska data som motsvarar SCAPIS bilderna utan att vara faktiska bilder. Tekniken bakom deepfake-videor kommer att användas för att generera nya medicinska bilder som kan delas mer öppet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFakta\nProjektet leds av Sahlgrenska Akademin och Göteborgs Universitet.

The task was to utilize machine learning to predict the content of the fluorescence images from the corresponding bright field images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nHistorically, most drugs have been small molecules binding to target proteins in the body. The problem is that one drug might bind to several similar proteins, creating unwanted side effects. A more specific way is to target the RNA sequence of the proteins where nanomedicines often are used to transport RNA cargo through the body.  These nanomedicines are small engineered machines made from biomolecules that interact with cell membranes and machinery to deliver RNA into cells where it can affect their function. \nTo be able to inject the nanomedicines into the skin will make treatments with nanomedicines easier for patients. One of the most important cellular targets is the fat cells (adipocytes) that we all have in our skin. To avoid using human test subjects, adipocyte cell cultures can be created from stem cells. One of the most important methods to investigate the uptake of nanomedicines in cells is cell imaging, which is the topic of this challenge.\nThe goal of cell imaging is to extract relevant information about the cell structures that can guide pharmaceutical development. To permit imaging of different cell structures, fluorescence microscopy is used to label specific parts of the cell.\nAstraZeneca has shared a data set consisting of pictures of stem-cell derived human adipocyte cell cultures  The cells have been imaged, using a robotic confocal microscope, at three different magnifications, using both brightfield and fluorescence imaging. \nThe task\nThe task was to utilize machine learning to combine the advantages of bright field and fluorescence imaging and at the same time avoid the toxic effects of cell labeling by predicting the content of the fluorescence images from the corresponding bright field images. \nDownload the complete problem formulation\n \nData\nThere are three sets of images corresponding to three different magnification settings (20x, 40x, and 60x) of the microscope.  For each field of view, there will be seven bright field images for different values of the focal plane, and three different fluorescence images corresponding to the labeling of nuclei, lipocytes, and cell-matrix respectively. There will be on the order of 50-100 images for each magnification setting. Each image is approximately 2156 by 2556 pixels in size, using 16 bits to represent each pixel value.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the left is a superimposed fluorescence image of cell nuclei (blue), lipid droplets (green), and cytoplasm (red).

Uppgiften var att använda maskininlärning för att förutsäga innehållet i fluorescensbilderna från de motsvarande ljusfältsbilderna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBakgrund\nHistoriskt sett har de flesta läkemedel varit små molekyler som binder till målproteiner i kroppen. Problemet är att ett läkemedel kan binda till flera liknande proteiner, vilket skapar oönskade bieffekter. Ett mer specifikt sätt är att rikta in sig på RNA-sekvensen av proteiner där nanomedicines ofta aanvänds för att transportera RNA-last genom kroppen. Dessa nanomediciner är små konstruerade maskiner gjorda av biomolekyler som interagerar med cellmembran och maskineri för att leverera RNA till celler där de kan påverka deras funktion.\nFör att kunna injicera nanomediciner i huden kommer att göra behandlingar med [nanomediciner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine) enklare för patienter. Ett av de viktigaste cellulära målen är fettcellerna (adipocyter) som vi alla har i vår hud. För att undvika att använda mänskliga försökspersoner kan adipocytcellkulturer skapas från stamceller. En av de viktigaste metoderna för att undersöka upptaget av nanomedicinerna i celler är cellbildning, vilket är ämnet för denna utmaning.\nMålet med cellbildning är att extrahera relevant information om cellstrukturen som kan vägleda läkemedelsutvecklingen. För att tillåta bildtagning av olika cellstrukturer används fluorescensmikroskopi för att märka specifika delar av cellen.\nAstraZeneca har delat ett dataset bestående av bilder av stamcellsavledda mänskliga adipocytcellkulturer. Cellerna har bildats med hjälp av ett robotiskt konfokalt mikroskop, vid tre olika förstoringsgrad, både med ljusfält och fluorescensbildning.\nUppgiften\nUppgiften var att använda maskininlärning för att kombinera fördelarna med ljusfält och fluorescensbildning och samtidigt undvika de toxiska effekterna av cellmärkning genom att förutsäga innehållet i fluorescensbilderna från de motsvarande ljusfältsbilderna.\nLadda ner den kompletta problemformuleringen\nData\nDet finns tre uppsättningar bilder som motsvarar tre olika förstoringsinställningar (20x, 40x, och 60x) av mikroskopet. För varje synfält kommer det att finnas sju ljusfältsbilder för olika värden av fokalplanet, och tre olika fluorescensbilder som motsvarar märkningen av kärnor, lipocyter, och cellmatriser. Det kommer att finnas cirka 50-100 bilder för varje förstoringsinställning.

It was noted that the mean average precision was a (weighted) average over the 2D and 3D properties.\nAs mentioned previously, the provided code had to be runnable on the AI Sweden infrastructure environment to be considered for evaluation. Failing to comply with this led to an invalid result. Moreover, the solution had to comply with the spirit of the challenge for eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge AnnotationZ Challenge prize ceremony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ebba Josefson Lindqvist\n\n\nInternational Relations Manager\nebba.josefson@ai.se\n+46 (0)73-254 29 03"}

Decoder language models are generative language models built specifically to be able to generate language (GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer). Read more here. GPT-SW3 is built on massive amounts of Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and English text data with the explicit purpose of being able to generate Swedish and Nordic languages texts.\nGPT-SW3 is not an off-the-shelf product or service ready for use. Developers must harness its capabilities to construct applications like chatbots or document summarization services.\nOrganizations can further tailor GPT-SW3 by training it on their own data sets for specific tasks.\n\n\n\nWho can use GPT-SW3?\n\nWith the open release, any company, government agency or organization can tap into the power of GPT-SW3 to build products and services.\n\n\n\nWhere do I find the model?\n\nYou can find the model at AI Sweden's repository in Hugging Face.\n\n\n\nHow can I use the model?\n\nYou can use GPT-SW3 for any type of task that is a good fit for an LLM: Text analysis solutions, classification tasks, content generation or moderation — GPT-SW3 can handle a vast array of language-based applications.\n\n\n\nDoes AI Sweden offer technical support?\n\nNo. GPT-SW3 is not a product and AI Sweden doesn't have the resources to provide support. However, there’s a vibrant Nordic developer community on Discord’s AI Nordics server, with a channel dedicated to GPT-SW3. There is also a developer community on Hugging Face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHear Daniel Gillblad, Scientific Director of AI Sweden, as he joins Nyhetsmorgon on TV4 to talk about the launch of GPT-SW3.\nInterview in Swedish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch clip on TV4 play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\nProject partners: AI Sweden, RISE and WASP WARA Media & Language.\nThe current GPT-SW3 models are trained on Linköpings University’s supercomputer, Berzelius, using the Nemo Megatron framework from NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Magnus Sahlgren\n\n\nHead of Research, NLU\nmagnus.sahlgren@ai.se\n+46 (0)76-315 34 80"}

Den är baserad på samma tekniska principer som OpenAI GPT-4. Genom den öppna licensen gör modellen det möjligt för svenska organisationer att bygga tillämpningar som tidigare inte var möjliga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVill ni använda GPT-SW3?\nGPT-SW3 är släppt med en öppen licens och finns tillgänglig i sex olika storlekar. 126 miljoner, 356 miljon, 1,3 miljarder, 6,7 miljarder, 20 miljarder och 40 miljarder parametrar.

Genom att ha analyserat stora mängder text har språkmodellen hittat mönster i det svenska språket. De mönstren kan sedan användas för att komplettera text: När man skickar in en kortare eller längre text till en GPT-modell kommer den att komplettera texten på ett statistiskt rimligt sätt.\nGPT-SW3 är däremot inte en produkt eller tjänst som är klar att användas. För att kunna använda modellen måste utvecklare bygga något med hjälp av den. Det kan vara en chattbot, en tjänst som sammanfattar dokument, eller något annat som bygger på språk.\nGenom att träna modellen vidare på egen träningsdata kan organisationer finjustera GPT-SW3 att utföra specifika uppgifter.\n\n\n\nKan vem som helst använda GPT-SW3?\n\nJa. Med den här releasen blir GPT-SW3 fritt tillgänglig för både företag, myndigheter och andra organisationer.\n\n\n\nVar hittar jag modellen?\n\nDu hittar GPT-SW3 på AI Swedens repository på Hugging Face. \n\n\n\nHur kan modellen användas?\n\nAlla typer av tillämpningar som är möjliga att bygga med storskaliga språkmodeller: Lösningar för textanalys, klassificering, textgenerering, textbearbetning, innehållsmoderering, chattfunktioner och så vidare.\n\n\n\nErbjuder AI Sweden teknisk support?\n\nNej. GPT-SW3 är inte en produkt, och AI Sweden är inte en organisation med resurser nog att ge teknisk support. Däremot finns en växande utvecklarcommunity kring modellen och användning av språkmodeller i Norden i stort. Den hittar du på Discord-servern AI Nordics, i GPT-SW3-kanalen.

Questions of data, representation, fairness, equality, and ethics are implicit and relevant to all projects in AI Sweden’s language technology portfolio and within the NLU/NLP ecosystem more broadly. \nThis project addresses the lack of a suitable response. So far, resources to tackle these issues in depth have not been readily available within the scope of technological projects. Secondly, the project is a reaction to international (mainly US-centered) debates about the risks and limitations of language models.\nProject and expected outcomes\nThe project aims to leverage the existing knowledge of researchers from the humanities and social sciences as well as civil society actors when needed to solve concrete questions and challenges that arise in the development of foundation models.\nAI Sweden will invite subject matter experts to be involved in the development pipeline of foundation models, considering questions regarding the training data and, consequently, the safe deployment as well as the social, cultural, and economic implications of foundation models such as GPT-SW3.\nThe project’s key innovation is to systematically and at scale involve subject matter experts in the development pipeline of foundation models, leverage existing domain knowledge, and together work on applied challenges and “big” questions based on concrete use cases and needs. The expert pool will provide a platform for knowledge exchange and readily available resources to quickly and effectively tackle data, representativeness, equality, and ethics issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe members of the Interdisciplinary Expert Pool for NLU\nResearchers and individual members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nTitle\nUniversity/Organization\nArea of interest/discipline\n\n\n\n      Kristy Beers Fägersten\n    \n\n      Professor of English Linguistics\n    \n\n      Södertörn University\n    \n\n      Linguistics, swearing, offensive language\n    \n\n\n\n      Mats Fridlund\n    \n\n      Deputy Director\n    \n\n      Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities (GRIDH), University of Gothenburg\n    \n\n      Digital history, science and technology studies, digital humanities\n    \n\n\n\n      Erik Winerö\n    \n\n      Teacher/PhD-student\n    \n\n      University of Gothenburg\n    \n\n      Primarily AI's effect on assessment practices in education\n    \n\n\n\n      Ylva Söderfeldt\n    \n\n      Associate professor\n    \n\n      Uppsala university\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n\n\n      Anna Metreveli\n    \n\n      PhD Student\n    \n\n      Stockholm University\n    \n\n      AI ethics\n    \n\n\n\n      Michał Dzieliński\n    \n\n      Assistant professor\n    \n\n      Stockholm University\n    \n\n      Economics/Finance\n    \n\n\n\n      Jacob Strandell\n    \n\n      Consultant, PhD\n    \n\n      Ungdomsbarometern AB\n    \n\n      Cognitive Sociology\n    \n\n\n\n      Mathilda Åkerlund\n    \n\n      Postdoctoral Researcher (Dr.)\n    \n\n      Umeå University\n    \n\n      Digital sociology; Internet Research; Politics; Far right\n    \n\n\n\n      Eric Orlowski\n    \n\n      Doctoral Candidate/Doktorand\n    \n\n      University College London/Uppsala University\n    \n\n      Social & Cultural Anthropology\n    \n\n\n\n      Jonas Svensson\n    \n\n      Professor\n    \n\n      Linnaeus university\n    \n\n      Study of Religions, Islamic Studies\n    \n\n\n\n      Jenny Björklund\n    \n\n      Professor\n    \n\n      Uppsala University\n    \n\n      Gender Studies\n    \n\n\n\n      Karl Berglund\n    \n\n      BUL/Assistant Professor\n    \n\n      Department of Literature, Uppsala University\n    \n\n      Computational text analysis, especially narrative analysis\n    \n\n\n\n      Jonas Andersson Schwarz\n    \n\n      Associate Professor\n    \n\n      Södertörn University\n    \n\n      Media & communications studies\n    \n\n\n\n      Dimitri Coelho Mollo\n    \n\n      Assistant Professor\n    \n\n      Umeå University\n    \n\n      Philosophy of AI and Cognitive Science\n    \n\n\n\n      Annika Raapke\n    \n\n      PhD\n    \n\n      Uppsala University\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n\n\n      Mariana S.

Hittills har resurser för att på djupet ta itu med dessa frågor inte varit lättillgängliga inom ramen för tekniska projekt. För det andra är projektet en reaktion på internationella (huvudsakligen USA-centrerade) debatter om risker och begränsningar för språkmodeller.\nProjektet och förväntade resultat\nProjektet syftar till att utnyttja den befintliga kunskapen hos forskare från humaniora och samhällsvetenskap samt civilsamhällesaktörer när det behövs för att lösa konkreta frågor och utmaningar som uppstår vid utvecklingen av grundmodeller.\nAI Sweden kommer att bjuda in ämnesspecialister för att delta i utvecklingsprocessen av grundmodeller, med hänsyn till frågor om träningsdata och följaktligen säker drift samt de sociala, kulturella och ekonomiska implikationerna av grundmodeller som GPT-SW3.\nProjektets nyckelinnovation är att systematiskt och i skala involvera ämnesspecialister i utvecklingsprocessen av grundmodeller, utnyttja befintlig domänkunskap och tillsammans arbeta med tillämpade utmaningar och \"stora\" frågor baserat på konkreta användningsfall och behov. Expertpoolen kommer att erbjuda en plattform för kunskapsutbyte och lättillgängliga resurser för att snabbt och effektivt hantera data, representativitet, jämlikhet och etiska frågor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedlemmarna i den tvärvetenskapliga expertpoolen för NLU\nForskare och individuella medlemmar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nTitle\nUniversity/Organization\nArea of interest/discipline\n\n\n\n      Kristy Beers Fägersten\n    \n\n      Professor of English Linguistics\n    \n\n      Södertörn University\n    \n\n      Linguistics, swearing, offensive language\n    \n\n\n\n      Mats Fridlund\n    \n\n      Deputy Director\n    \n\n      Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities (GRIDH), University of Gothenburg\n    \n\n      Digital history, science and technology studies, digital humanities\n    \n\n\n\n      Erik Winerö\n    \n\n      Teacher/PhD-student\n    \n\n      University of Gothenburg\n    \n\n      Primarily AI's effect on assessment practices in education\n    \n\n\n\n      Ylva Söderfeldt\n    \n\n      Associate professor\n    \n\n      Uppsala university\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n\n\n      Anna Metreveli\n    \n\n      PhD Student\n    \n\n      Stockholm University\n    \n\n      AI ethics\n    \n\n\n\n      Michał Dzieliński\n    \n\n      Assistant professor\n    \n\n      Stockholm University\n    \n\n      Economics/Finance\n    \n\n\n\n      Jacob Strandell\n    \n\n      Consultant, PhD\n    \n\n      Ungdomsbarometern AB\n    \n\n      Cognitive Sociology\n    \n\n\n\n      Mathilda Åkerlund\n    \n\n      Postdoctoral Researcher (Dr.)\n    \n\n      Umeå University\n    \n\n      Digital sociology; Internet Research; Politics; Far right\n    \n\n\n\n      Eric Orlowski\n    \n\n      Doctoral Candidate/Doktorand\n    \n\n      University College London/Uppsala University\n    \n\n      Social & Cultural Anthropology\n    \n\n\n\n      Jonas Svensson\n    \n\n      Professor\n    \n\n      Linnaeus university\n    \n\n      Study of Religions, Islamic Studies\n    \n\n\n\n      Jenny Björklund\n    \n\n      Professor\n    \n\n      Uppsala University\n    \n\n      Gender Studies\n    \n\n\n\n      Karl Berglund\n    \n\n      BUL/Assistant Professor\n    \n\n      Department of Literature, Uppsala University\n    \n\n      Computational text analysis, especially narrative analysis\n    \n\n\n\n      Jonas Andersson Schwarz\n    \n\n      Associate Professor\n    \n\n      Södertörn University\n    \n\n      Media & communications studies\n    \n\n\n\n      Dimitri Coelho Mollo\n    \n\n      Assistant Professor\n    \n\n      Umeå University\n    \n\n      Philosophy of AI and Cognitive Science\n    \n\n\n\n      Annika Raapke\n    \n\n      PhD\n    \n\n      Uppsala University\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n\n\n      Mariana S.

This year, they were filmed during their spring months and the extensive material holds plenty of interesting insights. But how do you structure 2000 hours of filmed material? Identifying and analyzing behaviors, events, and abnormalities is a time-consuming task for researchers.

Data scientists, programmers, and UX designers teamed up with WWF, the Swedish University of Agriculture (SLU), Stockholm Resilience Center, the Baltic Seabird Project, and AI Innovation of Sweden, to work out ways to structure data on the seabirds.\nThe hackathon showed the interesting results that can be achieved when professions from different areas of expertise share data and methods. Among the presentations were exciting applications of machine learning models on the annotated video material provided by WWF and SLU, together with ideas for how to involve and educate the public about seabirds and ocean health. \nA model project in fast-forward\nThis particular hackathon can also be viewed as a sped-up version of the typical Data Factory project. They all orbit around AI acceleration, providing connections and resources needed to see progress. Projects may vary in approach and conditions, but all share similarities with the Baltic Seabird Hackathon, as they in one way or another connect a problem and experts in that field, with AI expertise and the right resources, such as data and the infrastructure required. \nWinner of 10, 000 SEK was Team SkyRoads – Sheetal Reddy, Jayanth Reddy, Siddhartha. The team also received a trip including accomodation to Stora Karlsö, where the Guillemots mate and the filmed material is live streamed and recorded from a man-made ledge.\nSuccess factors in this hackathon were:\nBiologists and researchers with qualitative data in their hands and ideas for what might be achieved leveraging this data with artificial intelligence and machine learning. \nAnnotation of the data (in this case filmed material) with the area of use in mind.\nData Factory infrastructure and resources. \nData scientists and AI experts using pre-trained models.\nWith data of good quality and proper annotation, data scientists and programmers can start to test ideas of what can be extracted using algorithms and pre-trained models.

Datavetare, programmerare och UX-designers samarbetade med WWF, Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet (SLU), Stockholm Resilience Center, Baltic Seabird Project och AI Innovation of Sweden, för att hitta sätt att strukturera data om sjöfåglarna.\nHackathonen visade de intressanta resultat som kan uppnås när yrkespersoner från olika expertområden delar data och metoder. Bland presentationerna fanns spännande tillämpningar av maskininlärningsmodeller på det annoterade videomaterialet som tillhandahålls av WWF och SLU, tillsammans med idéer för hur man kan involvera och utbilda allmänheten om sjöfåglar och havshälsa. \nEtt modellprojekt i snabb framåtblick\nDenna speciella hackathon kan också ses som en snabb version av det typiska Data Factory-projektet. De kretsar alla kring AI-acceleration, och tillhandahåller de anslutningar och resurser som behövs för att se framsteg. Projekten kan variera i angreppsätt och förutsättningar, men alla delar likheter med Baltic Seabird Hackathon, eftersom de på ett eller annat sätt kopplar samman ett problem och experter inom det området, med AI-expertis och de rätta resurserna, såsom data och den infrastruktur som krävs. \nVinnare av 10,000 SEK var Team SkyRoads - Sheetal Reddy, Jayanth Reddy, Siddhartha. Laget fick även en resa inklusive boende till Stora Karlsö, där sillgrisslorna parar sig och det filmade materialet sänds live och spelas in från en människogjord klippavsats.\nFramgångsfaktorer i denna hackathon var:\nBiologer och forskare med kvalitativa data i sina händer och idéer om vad som kan uppnås genom att använda dessa data med artificiell intelligens och maskininlärning.  \nAnnotation av data (i detta fall filmat material) med användningsområdet i åtanke.\nData Factory-infrastruktur och resurser.  \nDatavetare och AI-experter som använder förtränade modeller.\nMed data av god kvalitet och korrekt annotering kan datavetare och programmerare börja testa idéer om vad som kan extraheras med hjälp av algoritmer och förtränade modeller.
